Published data by CSMC, which tested the effectiveness of CDCs in a mouse model of DMD,showed for the first time that the skeletal and cardiac improvements could be directly attributed to treatment with CDCs. The dataalso provide further evidence of the potential of CDCs to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration by first reducing inflammation,which then enables new healthy muscle to form, as was shown in the mouse model of DMD.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        CDCs are derived fromcardiospheres, or CSps, which are self-adherent multicellular clusters derived from the heart.

DMD affects approximately 1 in 3,600 male infantsworldwide, and it is estimated that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 boys and young men are living with the disease in the UnitedStates. DMD results from the lack of functional dystrophin protein caused by a gene mutation. The lack of dystrophin, an importantstructural component of muscle cells, causes them to have increased susceptibility to damage and to progressively die. Additionally,the absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibroticreplacement. In DMD patients, heart muscle cells progressively die and are replaced with scar tissue. This cardiomyopathy eventuallyleads to heart failure, which is currently the leading cause of death among those with DMD.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 6; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         5         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Patients with DMD experienceprogressive muscle weakness and degeneration starting at an early age. Generally, a loss of ambulation occurs after the first decadeof life and eventually the patients suffer respiratory and cardiac failure. Their lifespan is abbreviated and averages less thanthree decades. The annual cost of care for patients with DMD is very high and increases with disease progression. We thereforebelieve that DMD represents a significant market opportunity for our product candidate, CAP-1002.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">        <b>         <u>          CAP-1002 for the Treatment of DuchenneMuscular Dystrophy         </u>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Based on our understandingof the mechanism of action of CAP-1002 which has been seen in preclinical models of DMD, we believe that CAP-1002 has the potentialto decrease inflammation and slow muscle degeneration while exerting positive effects on muscle regeneration, all of which maytranslate into patients retaining muscle function for a longer period of time. Data supporting peripheral intravenous route ofadministration of CAP-1002 in the DMD setting has been provided by preclinical mouse studies where CDCs, the active ingredientin CAP-1002, have been shown to increase exercise capacity and diaphragmatic function.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        <font style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">         Weare currently developing CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD.

We reported positive interim 6-month results from HOPE-2 in 2019 andwe reported final top-line 12-month results in May 2020. Our further plans with respect to the clinical development of CAP-1002in DMD, including our decision to conduct a Phase III trial, will be based on the final guidance received from the FDA, our abilityto secure funding necessary to conduct the trial should we decide to pursue that path, our ability to partner with another companyto advance the development of CAP-1002 for DMD, and/or our ability to manufacture the product through a contract manufacturer,as well as other factors, some of which are not known at this time        </font>        .

We randomized20 patients in our HOPE-2 clinical trial. Approximately 80% of the patients were non-ambulant and all patients were on a stableregimen of steroids. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The clinical trialwas designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat, intravenous, or IV, doses of CAP-1002, in boys and young men with evidenceof skeletal muscle impairment regardless of ambulatory status and who are on a stable regimen of systemic glucocorticoids.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        While there are manyclinical initiatives in DMD, HOPE-2 is one of the very few to focus on non-ambulant patients. These boys and young men are lookingto maintain what function they have in their arms and hands, and Capricor’s previous study of a single intracoronary doseof CAP-1002 provided preliminary evidence of efficacy that CAP-1002 may be able to help DMD patients retain or slow the loss ofupper limb function.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The primary efficacyendpoint of the HOPE-2 trial is the relative change in patients’ abilities to perform manual tasks that relate to activitiesof daily living and are important to their quality of life. These abilities were measured through the Performance of the UpperLimb, or PUL, test. In the HOPE-2 study we have evaluated these through both the PUL 1.2 and 2.0 versions. Although the PUL 1.2version for the mid-level was the primary endpoint established for the trial, we also conducted an analysis using the PUL 2.0 versionas the FDA suggested the use of the updated PUL 2.0 version as the primary efficacy endpoint in support of a Biologics LicenseApplication, or BLA. HOPE-2 assessed the mid-level dimension of the PUL which evaluates one’s ability to use muscles extendingfrom the elbow to the hand, which muscles are essential for operating wheelchairs and performing other daily functions. In HOPE-2,additional secondary and exploratory endpoints such as cardiac function, pulmonary function, quality of life and additional measureswere included.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In July 2019,we reported interim top-line results from a pre-specified interim analysis of 6-month data from the HOPE-2 trial, which showedmeaningful results across several independent clinical measures.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 7; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         6         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In May 2020, wereported final top-line 12-month results.

Additionally,there was also a reduction in the biomarker CK-MB, an enzyme that is only released when there is cardiac muscle cell damage. Innormal human subjects, there is typically no CK-MB measurable in the blood. It is well accepted that continuous muscle cell damagein DMD leads to pathologically high enzyme levels associated with cardiac muscle cell loss. In HOPE-2 treatment with CAP-1002 wasassociated with a reduction in CK-MB levels as compared to placebo (p=0.006). This is the first ever study in DMD that correlatescardiac functional stabilization with reduction of a biomarker of cell damage.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

As a result, biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are made atdifferent times in the development cycle and cover different aspects of the product.

Orphan drug designationmust be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic candidate for that particular disease or condition.After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosedpublicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory reviewand approval process.

In recent years, therehave been multiple legal challenges to this FDA interpretation, and in August 2017, Congress amended the orphan drug provisionsof the FDCA through enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 to codify FDA’s longstanding interpretation. Section 527of the FDCA now expressly provides that if a sponsor of an orphan-designated drug that is otherwise the same as an already approveddrug for the same rare disease or condition is seeking orphan exclusivity, FDA shall require such sponsor to demonstrate that suchdrug is clinically superior to any already approved or licensed drug that is the same drug in order to obtain orphan drug exclusivity.Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the samedrug for a different disease or condition.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        <i>         Expedited Developmentand Review Programs        </i>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The FDA has a FastTrack program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meetcertain criteria.

Itinvolves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of thedevice’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, devicedesign, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee of $365,657 for most PMAs for fiscal year2021. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlledclinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Inparticular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. Aspart of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality SystemRegulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 21; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         20         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Split-Segment; Name: 2 -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        PMA approval is notguaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies inthe application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and thatcan substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues anapprovable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additionalinformation, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluationof the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter.A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessaryto make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approvalmay be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA.If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which canbe more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believesnecessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion,sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditionsof approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        After a device is placedon the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements.

Sales of pharmaceutical productsdepend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include governmenthealth programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, as well as commercial insurance, and managedhealthcare organizations. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates can besubject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approvedlist or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payorsmay refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug whena less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricescharged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal andstate governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreigngovernments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions onreimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The process for determiningwhether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate thatthe payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequatereimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for determiningcoverage or reimbursement. Many third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in settingtheir own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage andreimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particularmedical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, orwill provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to providescientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercializationof, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Third-party payorsare increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services,in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approvedfor marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness ofany products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not considerour product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or payor negotiationsmay not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Ifthese third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover ourproducts once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allowus to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decisionby a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effecton our sales, results of operations, and financial condition.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 23; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         22         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Additionally, effortsto contain healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government,state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, includingprice controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. There has also been heightenedgovernmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resultedin several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing,review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologiesfor drug products. We anticipate additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. These mayinclude price controls and cost-containment measures, or more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls andmeasures, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services,and potentially could reduce demand for our products once approved, create additional pricing pressures, or ultimately limit ournet revenue and results.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In addition, in somenon-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirementsgoverning drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrictthe range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the pricesof medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopta system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Therecan be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allowfavorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched inthe EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Coverage and reimbursementof our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which has not yet been granted EUA status, may be subject to unique regulatory policies. Underthe ACA preventive care mandate, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered in the individual orgroup market typically have at least one year before it must provide first-dollar coverage for a newly issued preventive care requirementor guideline. However, pursuant to the CARES Act, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered inthe individual or group market must cover any qualifying coronavirus preventive service 15 business days after the United StatesPreventive Services Task Force, or Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) designates such service as preventive. Third-partyreimbursement for providers administering any approved COVID-19 vaccine may affect market acceptance of the product. Currently,the CARES Act and its implementing regulations state (i) providers that participate in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Programmust administer a COVID-19 immunization regardless of an individual’s ability to pay or health insurance coverage status,(ii) providers may not seek any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from an immunization recipient, (iii) thatcoverage is required, without cost-sharing, for the administration of the immunization even if a third party, such as the federalgovernment, pays for the cost of the immunization, and (iv) that private health insurance plans must cover COVID-19 immunizationsand their administration even when provided by out-of-network providers for the duration of the public health emergency for COVID-19.There is no guarantee payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our COVID-19 vaccine, if approved, during or after thetermination of the public health emergency, nor can we guarantee that even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursementamount will be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Under the CARES Actand an accompanying interim final rule, Medicare beneficiaries are expected to have coverage for COVID-19 vaccines through MedicarePart B with no cost sharing. Coverage is further expected to apply whether the vaccine receives FDA authorization throughan EUA or is licensed under a BLA and will likely extend to employer-sponsored and individual health plans subject to the ACA’spreventive services standards. The outcome of current and future clinical trials, as well as the market demand for COVID-19 vaccinesmay impact patient eligibility and future coverage determinations. It is unclear whether the FDA will approve the administrationof our COVID-19 vaccine, and if so if approval will extend to children and adolescents, or if the vaccine will be required to beadministered once (i.e. one-time, double dose), annually, or if future booster shots will be required. We cannot predict continuedprevalence of COVID-19, whether herd immunity will be achieved which would affect the need for future administration of the vaccine,or whether the vaccine would be effective against future mutations or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such factors may impactwhether our vaccine, if approved, would be reimbursable under Medicare Part D rather than Part B and if our vaccine,if approved would be excluded from participating in certain federal entitlement programs such as the Vaccines for Children Program.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 24; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         23         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        <i>         Other HealthcareFraud and Abuse Laws        </i>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Although we currentlydo not have any products on the market, our activities, including current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcareprofessionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may be subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcementby the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.

The Anti-Kickback Statute has beeninterpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formularymanagers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activitiesfrom prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be allegedto be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exceptionor safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbordoes not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluatedon a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted thestatute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referralsof federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under theAnti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actualknowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codifiedcase law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes afalse or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statutemay result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civilpenalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties,including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion fromparticipation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        On November 20,2020, OIG issued two final regulations implementing significant modifications to regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-KickbackStatute. The first rule finalized new safe harbors and modified existing safe harbors to promote certain value-based and coordinatedcare arrangements and reduce regulatory burden, which are scheduled to become effective January 19, 2021. The second rule (theRebate Rule) created new safe harbor protection, scheduled to become effective January 29, 2021, for certain (i) point-of-salediscounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations, and their contractedpharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and (ii) fees for certain services that PBMs provide to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Inaddition, the Rebate Rule revised the discount safe harbor to exclude from protection price reductions (e.g., rebates) forpharmaceutical products from manufacturers to Part D plans when made directly or indirectly through a PBM, a change that isscheduled to become effective January 1, 2022. The Rebate Rule is intended to create incentives for manufacturers, coveredplans, and PBMs to shift from retrospective rebates to point-of-sale discounts, potentially lowering list prices of, and reducingconsumers’ out-of-pocket costs for, prescription drugs. In a court order filed on January 30, 2021, the Biden Administrationagreed to delay the implementation of provisions of the rule that were scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2022 byone year until January 1, 2023 in response to a suit brought by the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) challengingthe rule. The postponement does not affect provisions of the rule that were scheduled to take effect prior to January 1,2022. PMCA’s case will be held in abeyance pending the duration of HHS’s review of the rule, subject to the continuedconsent of the parties. We cannot predict the outcome of the Biden Administration’s review of the Rebate Rule or theoutcome of any subsequent litigation by PMCA. The federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person orentity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicareand Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons andentities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claimsby, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition,certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reportingof prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursementfor our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civilFalse Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civilpenalties of between $11,665 and $23,331 for each separate false claim per false claim or statement for penalties assessed afterJune 19, 2020 with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015 (and penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000per claim or statement with respect to violations occurring before that date). Other penalties include the potential for exclusionfrom participation in federal healthcare programs. Additionally, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, FalseClaims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 25; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         24         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        There is also the federalcriminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the federal civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those thatmake or present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.

Amongother things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independentcontractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a serviceon behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil andcriminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actionsfor damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuingfederal civil actions. Regulatory guidance and obligations continue to evolve. For example, on December 10, 2020, the Officefor Civil Rights issued a proposed rule aimed at reducing regulatory burdens that may exist in discouraging coordination ofcare, among other changes.

The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that isexpected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for PHI and certain clinical trial data, theCCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices may increase our compliance costs and legal risks. Additionally,the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was passed in November 2020, and will amend the CCPA beginning in 2023. The CPRAwill impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rightsprocesses, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data.It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increasedprivacy and information security enforcement. Additional state laws are being proposed, and new obligations may continue to arise.Additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required to respond to these rapidly changing privacylaw landscape.

This law was designed to expand access to health insurance coverage for uninsured and underinsuredindividuals while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things,the ACA contains provisions that may potentially affect the profitability of our products, including, for example, increased rebatesfor products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certainproducts under Medicare Part D, expansion of entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service’s pharmaceuticalpricing program, and a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products.Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcareproviders and entities. The framework of the ACA and other healthcare reforms continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative,regulatory, and administrative developments; in addition, healthcare-related litigation and judicial proceedings contribute toregulatory uncertainty. While Congress has not passed legislation to comprehensively repeal the ACA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actincluded a provision that, effective January 1, 2019, changed to $0 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed byACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referredto as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the individualmandate, with the penalty that was changed to $0 effective January 1, 2019, was unconstitutional and, further, could not besevered from the other provisions of the ACA. As a result, the court ruled that all of the provisions of the ACA were invalid.The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutionalas a result of the amendment changing the penalty amount to $0, but it remanded the case back to the district court for furtheranalysis of whether the individual mandate could be severed from the ACA. The Fifth Circuit’s decision was appealed to theSupreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on these issues and conducted oral argument in November 2020.The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in 2021. We cannot predict the full impact of this forthcoming decisionor other efforts to challenge, repeal, replace, or alter the implementation of the ACA or other healthcare laws, regulations, orreforms.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Other legislative changeshave been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included reductions to Medicarepayments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation,will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspensionof the payment reduction from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 enacted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, andEconomic Security Act, or the CARES Act. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reducedMedicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpaymentsto providers from three to five years. Further, effective January 1, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among otherthings, further amended portions of the Social Security Act implemented as part of the ACA to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-salediscount that pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the Coverage Gap Discount Program must provide to eligible MedicarePart D beneficiaries during the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,”and to reduce standard beneficiary cost sharing in the coverage gap from 30% to 25% in most Medicare Part D plans. In thefuture, there may be additional challenges and/or amendments to the ACA. It remains to be seen precisely what any new legislationwill provide, when or if it will be enacted, and what impact it may have on the availability and cost of healthcare items and services,including drug products.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In addition, in recentyears the pricing and costs of prescription pharmaceuticals has been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States.A number of federal reports and inquiries have focused on these issues, and various legislative and regulatory provisions havebeen proposed and enacted at the federal and state level that seek to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing,review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs,and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Additionally, on December 21, 2020, Congress passed a$900 billion U.S. coronavirus relief and government appropriations legislation, or the Act, which contains several important newdrug price reporting and transparency measures that could result in additional transparency with respect to manufacturers’prescription drug prices. Among other things, the Act includes provisions requiring Medicare Part D prescription drug plan,or the PDP, sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations, or MAOs, to implement tools to display Medicare Part D prescriptiondrug benefit information in real time and provisions requiring group and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverageto report information on certain pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 28; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         27         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Further, the incomingBiden Administration and the new Congress may pursue additional and potentially significant changes to the current healthcare laws,regulations, and related guidance. The Biden Administration issued a memorandum on January 20, 2021 (President Biden’sinauguration day) that, like similar memoranda issued by prior incoming Administrations, directed federal agencies to take stepsto halt, delay, or conduct further review of certain regulatory actions taken by the Trump Administration, such as those that hadnot taken effect by inauguration day. We cannot predict what regulatory actions the Biden Administration will take as a resultof its review. We also cannot predict what other healthcare reforms will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state levelor the effect of any future legislation or regulation. Accordingly, we face uncertainties that might result from additional reforms.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        From time to time,legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing thetesting, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulationsand policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policiesor interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">        <b>         Corporate Information        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        <font style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">         Ourcorporate headquarters are located at 8840 Wilshire Blvd., 2nd Floor, Beverly Hills, California 90211.

To date        <font style="color: #333333">         ,no products based on exosomes have been approved in the United States or the European Union. It is therefore difficult to accuratelypredict the developmental challenges we may face for our exosome technologies as they proceed through preclinical studies and clinicaltrials. In addition, because we have only conducted preclinical studies with our exosome technologies, we have not yet been ableto assess their safety in humans, and there may be short-term or long-term effects from treatment with our exosomes that we cannotpredict at this time. Also, animal models for the indications we may explore may not exist or may be difficult to obtain for ourpreclinical studies. As a result of these factors, we are unable to predict the time and cost of development of the exosome technologiesand we cannot predict whether the application of the exosome technologies, or any similar or competitive exosome technologies,will result in regulatory approval of any products. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in thefuture related to our exosomes or any of our research programs will not cause significant delays or        </font>        unanticipated costs,or that such development problems can be solved.

Any future negative developments in the field of exosomes and theiruse as therapies could also result in greater governmental regulation, stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatorydelays in the testing or approvals of our exosomes or other potential future product candidates.

Such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested,which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales and potential royalties, and thatsuch approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketingfollow-up studies.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">        <b>         <i>          If we or current or future collaborators,manufacturers, or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcementactions and substantial penalties, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products and may harm our reputation.         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Although we do notcurrently have any products on the market, if our therapeutic candidates or clinical trials become covered by federal health careprograms, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal, stateand foreign governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.

The term remuneration has been broadlyinterpreted to include anything of value. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended           </font>           by the Health Careand Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, among other things, amended theintent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of thisstatute or specific intent to violate it. The Anti-Kickback Statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturerson the one hand and individuals, such as healthcare providers and prescribers, patients, purchasers, pharmacy benefit managers,group purchasing organizations, third-party payors, wholesalers and distributors on the other hand, including, for example, consulting/speakingarrangements, discount and rebate offers, certain pricing arrangements, grants, charitable contributions, and patient support offerings,among others. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activitiesfrom prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged tobe intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exceptionor safe harbor. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation,plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal FalseClaims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment. Similarly, violationscan result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;          </td>         </tr>        </tbody>       </table>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" width="100%">        <tbody>         <tr style="vertical-align: top">          <td style="width: 0.5in">          </td>          <td style="width: 0.25in">           <font style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 10pt">            ·           </font>          </td>          <td style="text-align: justify">           the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower orqui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government,claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statementmaterial to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making or causing to be made, a false statement to avoid, decrease or concealan obligation to pay money to the federal government.

Moreover, eligibility for coverage doesnot necessarily signify that a drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development,manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Also, interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may be insufficient to cover ourcosts and may not be made permanent. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products maynot be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allowus to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in early stages of development, we are unable at thistime to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. In addition, obtaining coverage andreimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that couldrequire us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on apayor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision toprovide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’sdetermination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequatethird-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate returnon our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may notbe able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Increasingly, the third-partypayors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are seeking greater upfrontdiscounts, additional rebates and other concessions to reduce the prices for pharmaceutical products.

While Congress has notpassed legislation to comprehensively repeal the ACA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, included a provision that, effective January 1,2019, changed to $0 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintainqualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” InDecember 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the individual mandate, with the penalty that was changed to $0effective January 1, 2019, was unconstitutional and, further, could not be severed from the other provisions of the ACA. Asa result, the court ruled that all of the provisions of the ACA were invalid. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the districtcourt’s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional as a result of the amendment changing the penalty amountto $0, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the individual mandate could be severedfrom the ACA. The Fifth Circuit’s decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorarion these issues and conducted oral argument in November 2020. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its decision in2021.

On December 21, 2020, Congress passed a $900 billion U.S. coronavirusrelief and government appropriations legislation, or the Act, which contains several important new drug price reporting and transparencymeasures that could result in additional transparency with respect to manufacturers’ prescription drug prices. Among otherthings, the Act includes provisions requiring Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, or PDP, sponsors and Medicare Advantageorganizations, or MAOs, to implement tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time andprovisions requiring group and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage to report information on certain pharmacybenefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury.

To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainableor difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all of our employees,consultants, advisors and contractors to enter into agreements which prohibit unauthorized disclosure and use of confidential informationand, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions importantto our business. These agreements are often limited in duration and may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets,know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by othersof such information. In addition, enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secretsis expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.

There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, thecourt will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party’s activities do not infringe our rights tothese patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has modified certain legal tests so as to make it harder to obtain patents fromthe USPTO, and to defend issued patents against invalidity challenges. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to containinvalid claims according to the revised legal standards. Some of our own or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge andsubsequent invalidation in a variety of post-grant proceedings, before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the PTAB) of the USPTOor in litigation under the revised legal standards, which make it more difficult to defend the validity of claims in already issuedpatents.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Furthermore, a thirdparty may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party’spatent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or sellingour product candidates.

In addition, thereis a risk that a court could order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party’spatents. We have agreed to indemnify certain of our commercial partners against certain patent infringement claims brought by thirdparties. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants,including us, which patents cover various types of products, manufacturing processes or methods of use. The coverage of patentsis subject to claim construction by the courts, which is not always predictable or reasonable. If we are sued for patent infringement,we would need to demonstrate that our products, manufacturing processes or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claimsof the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular,is difficult since it requires a proof by clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issuedpatents.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        As some patent applicationsin the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United Statesand many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and because publications in thescientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applicationsfor technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Ourcompetitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patentapplications may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain licenses to theseissued patents covering such technologies. For patent applications filed before the Leahy-Smith Act, if another party has fileda United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declaredby the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, andit is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at thesame or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 59; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         58         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Some of our competitorsmay be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greaterresources.

Under the CIRM Loan Agreement,we were required to repay the CIRM loan with interest at maturity. So long as we were not in default, the Loan Agreement had provisionsallowing for forgiveness of the debt after the end of the project period, if we elected to abandon the project under certain circumstances.On November 17, 2017, we gave notice to CIRM that we were electing to abandon the CIRM-funded project pursuant to the LoanAgreement and on December 11, 2017, Capricor and CIRM entered into Amendment No. 3 to the CIRM Notice of Loan Award wherebythe total loan balance under the CIRM Loan Agreement was forgiven by CIRM thereby terminating Capricor’s and the Company’sobligation to repay the loan balance. The Company classified the forgiveness of the loan payable, consisting of principal and accruedinterest, of approximately $15.7 million as “other income” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and ComprehensiveIncome (Loss). The decision to terminate the Loan Award and forgive the loan balance was due to the abandonment of the ALLSTARproject at the end of the project period in accordance with Section 4.10 of the Loan Agreement and Article VII, Section Iof the CIRM Loan Administration Policy. Additionally, on June 16, 2016, Capricor entered into the CIRM Award with CIRM inthe amount of approximately $3.4 million to fund, in part, the HOPE-Duchenne trial.

Additionally, a number of pharmaceuticalcompanies have already obtained regulatory approval for COVID-19 vaccines, and other companies with significantly more resourcesthan us are developing COVID-19 vaccines.

Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmentalpayors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to useour products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of our products.

Many third-party payors often relyupon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have theirown methods and approval processes to decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage decisionsmay depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeuticalternatives are already available or subsequently become available. If any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate attractiveefficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage andamount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop through approval will be made on a plan-by-planbasis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverageand adequate reimbursement for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientificand clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process. Each plandetermines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay for the drug, the applicable formulary tier,and whether to require step therapy or other utilization management controls. Such decisions can strongly influence the adoptionof a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and treating healthcare providersgenerally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients may be unlikely to useand prescribers unlikely to prescribe our products unless adequate coverage is provided and reimbursement are available.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Additionally, a third-partypayor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Theprocess for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for settingthe price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors,such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge theprices charged for, drug products. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Governmentauthorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particularmedications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discountsfrom list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomicstudies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage andreimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursementwill be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketingapproval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be ableto successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Further, there havebeen a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell anyfuture drugs profitably. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementingcost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by genericproducts. We anticipate additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. These may includeprice controls and cost-containment measures, or more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures,any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and potentiallycould reduce demand for our products once approved, create additional pricing pressures, or ultimately limit our net revenue andresults. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates, if approved, will be considered medically reasonable andnecessary, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursementwill be available, or that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our productsare sold will not harm our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if they are approved for sale.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 66; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         65         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: center">        <b>         Risks Related to Product and EnvironmentalLiability        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">        <b>         <i>          Our products may expose us to potentialproduct liability, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurance to cover these liabilities.         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The testing, marketing,and sale of human cell therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, and services entail an inherent risk of adverse effects or medical complicationsto patients and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us.

In general, an ownership change occurs when stockholders owning 5% or more of a “loss corporation”(a corporation entitled to use NOL or other loss carryforwards) have increased their aggregate ownership of stock in such corporationby more than 50 percentage points during any three-year period. If an “ownership change” occurs, Section 382 ofthe Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownershipchange NOLs of the loss corporation experiencing the ownership change. The annual limitation is calculated by multiplying the losscorporation’s value immediately before the ownership change by the greater of the long-term tax-exempt rate determined bythe IRS in the month of the ownership change or the two preceding months. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect anyunused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. Section 383 of theCode also imposes a limitation on the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by the losscorporation’s pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The merger betweenNile Therapeutics, Inc., or Nile, and Capricor resulted in an “ownership change” of Nile.

Accordingly, the Company’s ability to utilize Nile’s NOL andtax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited.

Previously published data has shown that COVID-19 patients on ventilators experiencehigher mortality rates. While we are unable to definitively ascertain whether CAP-1002 improved patient outcomes, by analyzingblood samples and other tests, it was determined that CAP-1002 was associated with identifiable improvements in certain patientssuch as a decrease in white blood cell count, a decrease in IL-6, a decrease in C-reactive protein, and/or reduced reliance onsupplemental oxygen. However, the efficacy of CAP-1002 in treating COVID-19 was not demonstrated due to the small sample size,the fact that seven patients were contemporaneously on other experimental medications, and the lack of an established control group,among other factors.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In August 2020,we received FDA acceptance of our IND application for a clinical study of CAP-1002 in patients with severe or critical COVID-19.The INSPIRE trial is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that is enrolling up to 60 patients from severaltrial sites in the United States.

Since the initial publication in 2007, CDCshave been the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and have been administered to over 200 human subjects acrossseveral clinical trials. CDCs have been shown to exert potent immunomodulatory activity and to alter the immune system’sactivity to encourage cellular regeneration. We have been developing allogeneic CDCs (CAP-1002) as a product candidate for thetreatment of DMD and investigating their effects on skeletal and cardiac function. Preclinical and clinical data support the therapeuticconcept of administering CDCs as a means to address conditions in which the heart or skeletal muscle has been damaged.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In a variety of preclinicalexperimental models of heart injury, CDCs have been shown to stimulate cell proliferation and blood vessel growth and to inhibitprogrammed cell death and scar formation. Published data by CSMC, which tested the effectiveness of CDCs in a mouse model of DMD,showed for the first time that the skeletal and cardiac improvements could be directly attributed to treatment with CDCs.

Their size, low or null immunogenicity and ability to communicatein native cellular language potentially makes them an exciting new class of therapeutic agents with the potential to expand ourability to address complex biological responses.

Furthermore, there wasa change of approximately $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and a change of approximately $0.6 million in prepaidexpenses and other current assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. To the extentwe obtain sufficient capital and/or long-term debt funding and are able to continue developing our product candidates, includingif we expand our technology portfolio, engage in further research and development activities, and, in particular, conduct preclinicalstudies and clinical trials, we expect to continue incurring substantial losses, which will generate negative net cash flows fromoperating activities.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        We had cash flow providedby (used in) investing activities of approximately $5.4 million and $(3.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and2019, respectively.

We may seek to raise additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings,government grants, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be ableto secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, complete our clinical trials or if such funds become availableto us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. Moreover, to the extent that we raise additional fundsby issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involverestrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may benecessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorableto us.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        Our estimates regardingthe sufficiency of our financial resources are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong.

Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right of use assetsand short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leaseswith terms of 12 months or less. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement.Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Companywill renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases no less than on a quarterly basis.

Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm as an operating expense. Certain adjustments to the right of use asset may be required for items such as lease prepaymentsor incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Companyutilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basisthe amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. In transition toASC 842, the Company utilized the remaining lease term of its leases in determining the appropriate incremental borrowing rate.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        In accordance withASC 842, components of a lease should be bifurcated between lease components and non-lease components. The fixed and in-substancefixed contract consideration identified must then be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease componentsand non-lease components. However, ASC 842 provides a practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to not separatelease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset. In using this expedient, the lease component and non-leasecomponents are accounted for together as a single component. For real estate leases, the Company has elected to accountfor the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract considerationto the lease component only. This practical expedient is not elected for manufacturing facilities and equipment embedded inproduct supply arrangements.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">        <b>         <i>          Revenue Recognition         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        For contracts completedas of December 31, 2017, revenue was recognized in accordance with ASC 605 and other standards which have been supersededfor subsequent fiscal years.

We will manage this exposure by performing ongoing evaluations of our investments. Due to the short-termmaturities, if any, of our investments to date, their carrying value has always approximated their fair value.

To the extent the Company issuesadditional equity securities, its existing stockholders would experience substantial dilution.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 97; Value: 2 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1pt solid">        <p style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         96         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: center">        <font style="text-transform: uppercase">         <b>          CAPRICORTHERAPEUTICS, INC.         </b>        </font>       </p>       <p style="text-align: center; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">        <font style="text-transform: uppercase">         <b>          Notesto CONSOLIDATED financial statements         </b>        </font>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: center">        <font style="text-transform: uppercase">         <b>          DECEMBER31, 2020 AND 2019         </b>        </font>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; width: 100%">        <tbody>         <tr style="vertical-align: top; text-align: justify">          <td style="width: 0in">          </td>          <td style="width: 0.25in; text-align: left">           <font style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">            <b>             1.            </b>           </font>          </td>          <td style="text-align: justify">           <font style="font-size: 10pt">            <b>             ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARYOF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)            </b>           </font>          </td>         </tr>        </tbody>       </table>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">        <u>         Reverse Stock Split        </u>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        On June 4, 2019,the Company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one-for-ten pursuant to a Certificateof Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

We make estimates of our accrued expensesas of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at thattime. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting fromCROs and other third-party vendors.

The value of the portionof the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’sstatements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes model.This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and value of its common stock and the expected term of thestock options, all of which are highly complex and subjective variables. The variables take into consideration, among other things,actual and projected stock option exercise behavior. For employees and directors, the expected life was calculated based on thesimplified method as described by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment. For other service providers,the expected life was calculated using the contractual term of the award. The Company's estimate of expected volatility was basedon the historical stock price of the Company. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available onU.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected term of the options.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">        <u>         Basic and Diluted Loss per Share        </u>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        The Company reportsearnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10,        <i>         Earnings per Share.        </i>        Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed bydividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding duringthe period.

On June 20,2016, Capricor entered into a Loan Election Agreement with CIRM whereby, among other things, CIRM and Capricor agreed thatif Capricor elects to convert the grant into a loan, the term of the loan could be up to five years from the date of executionof the applicable loan agreement; provided that the maturity date of the loan will not surpass the ten-year anniversary of thegrant date of the CIRM Award. Beginning on the date of the loan, the loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance,plus the interest that has accrued prior to the election point according to the terms set forth in CIRM’s Loan Policy (the “New Loan Balance”), at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR rate for a three-month deposit in U.S. dollars, as publishedby the Wall Street Journal on the loan date, plus one percent. Interest shall be compounded annually on the outstanding New LoanBalance commencing with the loan date and the interest shall be payable, together with the New Loan Balance, upon the due dateof the loan. If Capricor elects to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, certain requirements of the CIRM Award will no longer beapplicable, including the revenue sharing requirements. Capricor has not yet made its decision as to whether it will elect to convertthe CIRM Award into a loan. If we elect to do so, Capricor would be required to repay some or all of the amounts awarded by CIRM;therefore, the Company accounts for this award as a liability rather than income.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">        <font style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">         InJune 2019, Capricor completed all milestones associated with the CIRM Award and expended all funds received.

The development milestones range from $100,000 upon successful completion ofa full Phase I clinical study to $1,000,000 upon full FDA market approval and are fully creditable against payments owed by Capricorto JHU on account of sublicense consideration attributable to milestone payments received from a sublicensee. The maximum aggregateamount of milestone payments payable under the JHU License Agreement, as amended, is $1,850,000. In May 2015, Capricor paidthe development milestone related to Phase I that was owed to JHU pursuant to the terms of the JHU License Agreement.
