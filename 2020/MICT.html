Financing transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issuedsecurities, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading priceof Common Stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number ofshares of Common Stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market priceof MICT stock. If MICT stockholders sell, or the market perceives that its stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, includingthe ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon theexercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of Common Stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of sharesof Common Stock may make it more difficult for MICT to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and pricethat MICT deems reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, MICT may become involved in securities class action litigation arisingout of volatility resulting from such sales that could divert management’s attention and harm MICT’s business.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0">        <b>         <i>          We may acquire other companies ortechnologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwisedisrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        We may in the futureseek to acquire or invest in other businesses, features or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our market,enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities.

As previously disclosed, in March 2017, MICT entered into an Investment Banking Agreement (the“Sunrise Agreement”) with Sunrise Securities LLC and Trump Securities LLC (collectively, “Sunrise”) throughSunrise’s principal, Amnon Mandelbaum, pursuant to which Sunrise agreed to assist MICT in identifying, analyzing, structuring,and negotiating suitable business opportunities, such as a sale of stock or assets, merger, tender offer, joint venture, financingarrangement, private placement, or any similar transaction or combination thereof. The parties had disagreements about, among otherthings, the applicability of the Sunrise Agreement, and the Company received demand letters and other correspondences from Sunrisethreatening litigation in connection therewith. As of the date hereof, the parties have executed a settlement and release agreementfor the release and waiver of the above claims however, MICT was not able to timely file a registration statement to register theshares, and shares underlying the warrants per the settlement agreement. The Sunrise parties notified MICT that it has breachedthe settlement agreement. MICT has made a significant offer to the Sunrise parties to settle such matter and is negotiatingwith the Sunrise parties to resolve this issue immediately.

As a result, it may be difficult forinvestors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgmentspredicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally,it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel, the UK orPRC. UK, PRC or Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because such jurisdictionsare not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if such courts agree to hear a claim, they may determinethat Israeli, UK or PRC law, as applicable, and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable,the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process.

Currently, Micronetdoes not have a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that Micronet will considerengaging in such hedging activities on a case by case basis. To the extent MICT is unable to fully match sales and purchases indifferent currencies, its business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Following the Merger, Intermediate’srevenue and expenses have been and are expected to continue to be primarily denominated in RMB and we are exposed to the risksassociated with the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate of RMB. Should RMB appreciate against other currencies, the valueof the proceeds from this offering and any future financings, which are to be converted from U.S. dollar or other currencies intoRMB, would be reduced and might accordingly hinder our business development due to the lessened amount of funds raised.

Accordingly, MICT’s business, financial condition, results of operationsand prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic, social conditions and government policies in Chinagenerally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level ofgovernment involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although thePRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of stateownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portionof productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significantrole in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant controlover China’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations,setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        While the Chinese economyhas experienced significant growth over the past decades, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectorsof the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in thepolicies of the PRC government or in the laws and regulations in China, could have a material adverse effect on the overall economicgrowth of China. Such developments could adversely affect MICT’s business and operating results, lead to reduction in demandfor MICT’s services and adversely affect MICT’s competitive position. COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact onChinese and global economy in the first half of 2020. Whether this will lead to a prolonged downturn in the economy is still unknown.The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some ofthese measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our Intermediate division’sfinancial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changesin tax regulations. In addition, in the past the PRC government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment,to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affectour Intermediate division’s business and operating results.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0">        <b>         <i>          The PRC legal system embodies uncertaintieswhich could limit the legal protections available to us.         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        PRC laws and the PRClegal system in general may have a significant impact on our business operations in China.

SAT Circular 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee(or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets. Under the SAT Circular 7, the transfer which meetsall of the following circumstances shall be deemed as having no reasonable commercial purpose: (i) over 75% of the value ofthe equity interests of the offshore holding company are directly or indirectly derived from PRC taxable properties; (ii) atany time during the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the total properties of the offshore holding company are investmentswithin PRC territory, or in the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the offshore holding company’s total incomeis directly or indirectly derived from within PRC territory; (iii) the function performed and risks assumed by the offshoreholding company are insufficient to substantiate its corporate existence; or (iv) the foreign income tax imposed on the indirecttransfer is lower than the PRC tax imposed on the direct transfer of the PRC taxable properties. In October 2017, SAT issuedthe Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-resident Enterprise IncomeTax at Source, or SAT Circular 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017 and was amended on June 15, 2018. The SAT Circular37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of nonresident enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprisetransfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an indirect transfer,the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may reportsuch indirect transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authoritymay disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established forthe purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 54; Value: 1 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1.5pt solid">        <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         51         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        We face uncertaintiesas to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions that involve PRC taxable assets, such as offshorerestructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments.

A state of hostility varying in degree and intensityhas led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israeland Palestinians, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel’s relationship with its Arabcitizens and several Arab countries, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria.

An Industrial Company, accordingto the applicable Israeli law (Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969), is a company that resides in Israel (eitherincorporated in Israel or managed and controlled from Israel) that, during the relevant tax year, derives at least 90% of its incomefrom an Industrial Factory. An Industrial Factory means a factory that is owned by an Industrial Company and where its manufacturingoperations constitute a vast majority of the factory’s total operations/business. The tax benefits of qualifying as an IndustrialCompany include a reduction of the corporate tax from 24% for “Regular Entities” and 16% or 7.5% for “PreferredEnterprises” (depending on the location of industry) in 2017. In addition, in recent years the Israeli government has reducedthe benefits available under this program and has indicated that it may further reduce or eliminate benefits in the future. Thereis no assurance that Micronet will continue to qualify for these tax benefits or that such tax benefits will continue to be available.The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase the amount of tax payable by Micronet and, accordingly, reduceMICT’s net profit after tax and negatively impact profits, if any, which may adversely affect the value of MICT’s equityinterest in Micronet.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 61; Value: 1 -->       <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1.5pt solid">        <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">         <!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->         58         <!-- Field: /Sequence -->        </p>       </div>       <div style="break-before: page; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt">        <p style="margin: 0pt">        </p>       </div>       <!-- Field: /Page -->       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0">        <b>         <i>          Micronet is subject to regulationsin the United States and Europe, which if failed to be met, could negatively impact Micronet’s and MICT’s businessand reputation.         </i>        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        Micronet’s businessis subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE andRestriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to thoseimplemented in the United States by the FCC and in Europe by the European Commission, respectively.

On January 26, 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Testfor Goodwill Impairment." The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to bemeasured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimatedfair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that requiredcompanies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair valuesand a residual measurement approach.

On January 26, 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifyingthe Test for Goodwill Impairment." The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairmentto be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and theestimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment modelthat required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimatedfair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwillallocated to that reporting unit.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">        <b>         Revenue Recognition        </b>       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        With respect to Micronet applicable revenue recognitionGAAP requirements, Micronet implements a revenue recognition policy pursuant to which it recognizes its revenues at the amountto which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.

The standard also requires that we recognize creditimpairment losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities through an allowance for credit losses instead of a reductionin the cost basis. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15,2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transitionwith a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date. The updated standarddid not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">        On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles-Goodwilland Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairmentby requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step ofthe previous impairment model that required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairmentsbased on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceedthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The impact of the new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstancesof future individual impairments, if any.       </p>       <p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0;
