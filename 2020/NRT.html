behalf of the owners ofbeneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds overridingroyalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain concessionsor leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The rights are heldunder contracts with local German exploration and developmentsubsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the RoyalDutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group").  Underthese contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties onthe proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved.At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas wellgas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur.  See Item 2 ofthis Report for descriptions of the relationships of these companiesand certain of these contracts.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The royalty rights werereceived by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company")upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975.  The Company wasorganized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation(the "Corporation").  The Trust is administered by trustees (the"Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, asamended (the "Trust Agreement").       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        Neither the Trust nor theTrustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activitiesor operations.  The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify,collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to theTrust.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterlydistributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf ofthe unit owners.  Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to theirdistribution are invested in an interest bearing money market account.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        There has been no significantchange in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during thepast fiscal year.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        As part of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance mattersfor publicly held entities.  The Trust is complying with therequirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees havechosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on thepassive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future.  In thatconnection, the Trustees have directed that certain of the additionalstatements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference inthis Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made eventhough some of such statements and disclosures might not now or inthe future be required to be made by the Trust.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        In addition, the New YorkStock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest ofthe Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governancerules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are notapplicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as aroyalty trust and holds only overriding royalty rights.  The Trusteeshave, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and aCompensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so inthe future.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        (b)        <u>         NarrativeDescription of Business        </u>        .  Under the Trust Agreement,the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restrictedto collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unitowners of the net income after payment of administrative andrelated expenses.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The overriding royaltyrights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreementsoriginally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessorCorporation during the early 1930s.  The Trust's primary royaltyrights are based on a government granted concessions and remain ineffect as long as there are continued production activities and/orexploration efforts within the concession.  It is generallyanticipated that production activities will continue as long asthey remain economically profitable.  The Trust holds other royaltyrights, which are based onleases which have passed their original expiration dates.  Theseleases remain in effect as long as there is continued production orthe lessor does not cancel the lease.  Individual lessors willnormally not seek termination of the rights originally grantedbecause the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors ifsales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leasedland.  Additionally, termination by individual lessors would resultin the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        Royalties are paid to theTrust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on aregular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros.  Afterthe royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account withDeutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle anyoutstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of10,000 Euros.  The Trust's standing instructions with Deutsche Bank arethen executed converting the remainder of Euro denominated funds intoU.S. dollars based upon the available exchange rates.  Following thisconversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are automatically transferredto the Trust's bank account in the U.S.  The Trust does not engage inactivities to hedge against currency risk, and the fluctuations in theconversion rate impact its financial results.  Since theactual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, themarket risk with respect to these deposits is small.  The Trust has notexperienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros intoU.S. dollars.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        As the holder of overridingroyalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract oroperation of law, to compel production or exploration.  Moreover, ifan operator should determine to terminate production in any concessionor lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royaltyrights for that area would thereby be terminated.  Under certainroyalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised ofany intention to surrender lease or concession rights.  While theTrust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up asurrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-partyoperator to develop such concession or lease.  There is no assurancethat the Trust could find such a third party.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The exploration for and theproduction of gas and oil is a speculative business.  The Trust has nomeans of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at eithertheir present levels or otherwise.  The Trust has no role in any ofthe operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gaspricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income.In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil andthe effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to theTrust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accuratelyprojected.  Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.While known reserves may increase as additional development addsquantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknownreserves is finite and will decline over time.  Given these factors,along with the uncertainty in worldwide and local German economicconditions and the fact that the Trustees have no informationbeyond that information which is generally available to the public,the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        While Germany has lawsrelating to environmental protection, the Trustees do nothave detailed information concerning the present or possible effectof such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royaltyrights on production and sale of products from those areas.  TheTrustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that onJuly 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed inGermany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth.  The lawrequires that an environmental impact study be performed and thatpermission by the relevant water authority be granted in order toensure the protection of drinking water supplies.  Based upon ananalysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultanthas informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in allcurrent productive zones within the Oldenburg concession (asdefined below) both dueto the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.However, the operating companies would still have to comply withall regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. Thefailure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatoryrequirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oilproduction by the operating companies and could adversely affectthe royalties paid to the Trust.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The Trust, in cooperationwith a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregationat Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations ofthe books and records of the operating companies to verifycompliance with the computation provisions of the applicableagreements.  As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination isconducted on a biennial basis.  From time to time, theseexaminations disclose computational errors or errors frominappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriateadjustments are requested to be made.  As a result of theamendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricingsimplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by theTrust's German accountants have been simplified since theseexaminations are primarily limited to the verification of the gasquantities sold.  Although these periodic examinations may alsodisclose other matters that are subject to dispute between theparties, these disputes have historically been resolved throughnegotiations without the need for litigation.  The Trust'saccountants in Germany will begin their examination of the operatingcompanies for calendar years 2019 and 2020 in November 2021 when thefinal sales figures and the German Border Import gas Prices (seeItem 7 of this Report) became available.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        (c)        <u>         FinancialInformation about Geographic Areas        </u>        .  In Item 2 of thisReport, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area andoperating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trustduring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        (d)        <u>         Informationabout our Trustees andExecutive Officers        </u>        .  As specified in theTrust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are managed by not morethan five individual Trustees who receive compensation determinedunder that same agreement.

The Oldenburg concession coversapproximately 1,386,000 acres, is located in the German federal stateof Lower Saxony, and is the area from which natural gas, sulfur and oilare extracted.  The Oldenburg concession currently provides 100% of allthe royalties received by the Trust.  The Oldenburg concession is heldby Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operatingsubsidiary of ExxonMobil, and by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft("OEG").  As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil ownstwo-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ownsone-third of OEG.  BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venturein which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50%,administers the concession held by OEG.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        In 2002, Mobil Erdgas andBEB formed ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG") to carryout all exploration, drilling and production activities.

Under the MobilAgreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation ofroyalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together accountfor approximately 99% of all the royalties under said agreement.Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royaltypayments under the Mobil Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreementdescribed below) due to the higher royalty rate specified by thatagreement.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The Trust is also entitledunder an agreement with Mobil Erdgas to receive a 2% royalty on grossreceipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gasproduced from the western part of Oldenburg (the "Mobil SulfurAgreement").  The payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned uponsales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed uponbase price.  This base price is adjusted annually by an inflation index.When the average quarterly selling price falls below the indexed baseprice, no sulfur royalties are paid by Mobil Erdgas.  Sulfur royaltiesunder the Mobil Agreement totaled $71,280 and $150,157 during fiscal 2020and 2019, respectively.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        Under another set of rightscovering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to the agreementwith OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667% on grossreceipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour gas) lessa certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG Agreement").  Under theOEG Agreement, 50% of the field handling and treatment costs asreported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the gross salesreceipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to theTrust.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        Vermilion Energy Inc.("Vermilion"), a Canadian based international oil and gas producer,entered into a Farm-In Agreement (the "Farm-In Agreement") with MobilErdgas and BEB effective as of January 1, 2016.

TheCost Depletion Report, dated November 30, 2020, was prepared byGraves &amp; Co. Consulting, LLC, 2777 Allen Parkway, Suite 1200,Houston, Texas 77019 ("Graves &amp; Co.").  Graves &amp; Co. is anindependent petroleum and natural gas consulting organizationspecialized in analyzing hydrocarbon reserves.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The Cost Depletion Reportprovides documentation supporting the calculation of the costdepletion percentage for the 2020 calendar year based on the use ofcertain production data and the estimated net proved producingreserves as of October 1, 2020 for the primary area in which theTrust holds overriding royalty rights.  In order to permit timelyfiling of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practiceof the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared forthe 12-month period ended September 30, 2020.  While this is onemonth prior to the end of the fiscal year of the Trust, theinformation available for production and sales through the end ofSeptember is the most complete information available at a dateearly enough to permit the timely preparation of the variousreports required.  Unit owners are referred to the full text of theCost Depletion Report contained herein for further details.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The cost depletion percentageis prepared by Graves &amp; Co. for the Trust's unit owners for taxreporting purposes.  The cost depletion percentage in that report forcalendar 2020 is 16.5776%.  Specific details relative to the Trust'sincome and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply tothe calculation of taxable income for the 2020 calendar year areincluded on removable pages in the 2020 Annual Report.  Additionally,the tax reporting information for 2020 is available on the Trust'swebsite, http://neort.com/tax-letters.html.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The primary purpose of theCost Depletion Report is the preparation of the cost depletionpercentage for use by unit owners in their own tax reporting.  Theonly information provided to the Trust that can be utilized in thecalculation of the cost depletion percentage is current andhistorical production and sales of proved producing reserves.  Forthe western half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receivesquarterly production and sales information on a well-by-well basis.For the eastern half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receivescumulative quarterly production and sales information on two generalareas.  These general areas encompass numerous fields with varyingnumbers of wells.  Pursuant to the arrangements under which theTrust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is notconsidered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has noaccess to the operating companies' proprietary informationconcerning producing field reservoir data.  The Trustees have beenadvised by their German counsel that publication of such informationis not required under applicable law in Germany and that the royaltyrights do not grant the Trust the right to require or compel therelease of such information.  Efforts to obtain suchinformation from the operating companies have not been successful.The information made available to the Trust by the operatingcompanies does not include any of the following: reserve estimates,capitalized costs, production cost estimates, revenue projections,producing field reservoir data (including pressure data, permeability,porosity and thickness of producing zone) or other similarinformation.  While the limited information available to the Trustpermits the calculation of the cost depletion percentage, it does notchange the uncertainty with respect to the estimate of provedproducing reserves.  In addition, it is impossible for the Trust orits consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probablefuture net recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographicareas.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        The Trust has the authorityto examine, but only for certain limited purposes, the operatingcompanies' sales and production from the royalty areas.  The Trustalso has access to published materials in Germany from W.E.G. (aGerman organization equivalent to the American Petroleum Instituteor the American Gas Association).  The use of such statisticalinformation relating to production and sales necessarily involvesextrapolations and projections.  Both Graves &amp; Co. and the Trusteesbelieve the use of the material available is appropriate andsuitable for preparation of the cost depletion percentage and theestimates described in the Cost Depletion Report.  The Trustees andGraves &amp; Co. believe this report and these estimates to be reasonableand appropriate but assume that these estimates may vary fromstatistical estimates which could be made if reservoir productioninformation (of the kind normally available to producing companiesin the United States) were available.  The limited informationavailable makes it inappropriate to make projections or estimatesof proved or probable reserves of any category or class other thanthe estimated net proved producing reserves described in the CostDepletion Report.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">        Attachment A of the CostDepletion Report shows a schedule of estimated net proved producingreserves of the Trust's royalty properties, computed as ofOctober 1, 2020 and a five-year schedule of gas, sulfur and oilsales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, 2019, 2018,2017 and 2016 computed from quarterly sales reports of operatingcompanies received by the Trust during such periods.       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 3.        <u>         <a name="ref5">          LegalProceedings         </a>        </u>        <a name="ref5">         .        </a>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 55px">        The Trust is not a party toany pending legal proceedings.       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 4.        <u>         <a name="ref6">          Mine SafetyDisclosures         </a>        </u>        <a name="ref6">         .        </a>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 55px">        Not Applicable.       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 5.        <u>         <a name="ref24">          Market forRegistrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, andIssuer         </a>        </u>        <a name="ref24">         <u>          Purchases of EquitySecurities         </u>         .        </a>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 55px">        None.       </p>       <br/>       <p align="center">        PART II       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 6.        <u>         <a name="ref8">          Selected FinancialData         </a>        </u>        .       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent: 55px">        Not Applicable.       </p>       <p>       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 7.        <u>         <a name="ref9">          Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of         </a>        </u>        <a name="ref9">         <u>          Operations         </u>        </a>        .       </p>       <p align="left">        <u>         Executive Summary        </u>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The Trust is a passive fixedinvestment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receivesincome under those rights from certain operating companies, paysits expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unitowners.  As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of incomeare made on a quarterly basis.  These distributions, as determinedby the Trustees, constitute substantially all of the funds on handafter provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The Trust does not engage inany business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas overwhich it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in suchactivities by the Trust Agreement.  There are no requirements,therefore, for capital resources with which to make capitalexpenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt ofroyalty revenues by the Trust.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The properties of the Trustare described in Item 2. Properties of this Report.  Of particularimportance with respect to royalty income are the two royaltyagreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement.  The MobilAgreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburgconcession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of itsroyalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higherroyalty rate of 4%.  The OEG Agreement covers gas sales fromthe entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667% issignificantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondinglylower.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The operating companies paymonthly royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas,sulfur and oil.  Of these three products, natural gas providedapproximately 94% of the total royalties in fiscal 2020.  The amountof royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from whichthe gas is sold and the exchange rate.  For purposes of the royaltycalculations, the determination of the gas price is explained indetail in the following three paragraphs.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        On August 26, 2016, theMobil and OEG Agreements were amended establishing a new base forthe determination of gas prices upon which the Trust's royalties arecalculated.  This new base is set as the state assessment base fornatural gas used by the operating companies in their calculation ofroyalties payable to the State of Lower Saxony.  This change reflectsa shift from the use of gas ex-field prices ("contractual prices") tothe prices calculated for the German Border Import gas Price ("GBIP").For the royalty calculations, the average GBIP used under the Mobiland OEG Royalty Agreements has been and will continue to be increasedby 1% and 3%, respectively.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The change to the GBIP wasintended to be revenue neutral for the Trust in comparison to theprevious pricing methodology.  Additionally, this change was intendedto reduce the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminateongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related parties,and reduce prior year adjustments to the normally scheduled year-endreconciliation.  The pricing basis has eliminated certain costs(transportation and plant gas storage) that were previously deductibleprior to the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        On approximately the 25th ofthe months of January, April, July and October, the operating companiesfirst calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous calendarquarter.  This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by the averageadjusted GBIP available at that time.  Due to delays in the calculationof the GBIP by the state, the most current GBIP is from a periodending two months prior to the end of the relevant calendar quarter.The respective royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms themonthly royalty payments to the Trust (payable on the 15th of eachmonth) for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter.  At the same time thatthe operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties thatwere payable for the prior calendar quarter, they look at the actualamount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that period andcalculate the difference between what was paid and what was payable.Any positive adjustments are paid immediately and any negativeadjustments would be deducted from the royalty payment for the firstmonth of the next fiscal quarter.  In September of the succeedingcalendar year, the operating companies make the final determinationof any necessary royalty adjustments for the prior calendar year witha positive or negative adjustment made accordingly.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        There are two types ofnatural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas andsour gas.  Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs notreatment before it can be sold.  Sour gas, in comparison, must beprocessed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it canbe sold.  The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide andother contaminants.  The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form isconverted to sulfur in a solid form, which is sold separately.  Withfull operation of the plant, raw gas input capacity stands atapproximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day.  As needed,EMPG conducts maintenance on the plant generally during the summermonths when demand is lower.  As part of the regular 10-yearscheduled maintenance, Grossenkneten underwent an overhaul fromSeptember 8, 2020 through October 13, 2020.  During this time theplant was completely shut down and no sour gas was processed.Since sour gas accounts for 75% of overall gas sales and 98% ofwestern gas sales, this shutdown significantly impacted royaltyincome during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and will likelyimpact royalty income during the upcoming first quarter of fiscal2021.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        For unit owners, changes inthe U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact.  Thisimpact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to theTrust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicableexchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bankaccount in the United States.  In relation to the U.S. dollar, astronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro wouldyield fewer U.S. dollars.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        Seasonal demand factorsaffect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as theyrelate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, buton average they are generally not material to the annual incomereceived under the Trust's royalty rights.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The Trust has no means ofensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at theirpresent level or otherwise.  The Trust's consultant in Germanyprovides general information to the Trust on the German and Europeaneconomies and energy markets.  This information provides a contextin which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies.  TheTrust's consultant receives reports from EMPG with respect tocurrent and planned drilling and exploration efforts.  However, EMPGand the operating companies continue to limit the information flowto that which is required by German law, and the Trust is not ableto confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by EMPGor the operating companies.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The low level ofadministrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflationon costs.  Sustained price inflation would be reflected in salesprices.  Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis onwhich the royalties paid to the Trust are computed.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The Trust has previouslydistributed information regarding the negative adjustment ofEuros 444,931 that is being carried over to the first quarter offiscal 2021.  Given the level of expected royalty payments for thefirst quarter of fiscal 2021 based upon the prior calendar quarter'sactual royalties paid, the Trust anticipates the royalties for thefirst quarter of fiscal 2021 will be almost completely offset by thisnegative adjustment.  It is possible that the anticipated royalties forthe first quarter of fiscal 2021 may be increased by a positive end ofquarter royalty adjustment in January; however, the two-week totalshutdown of the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant in early Octobermay reduce the potential for such a positive adjustment.  No assuranceswith respect to any positive end of quarter royalty adjustment can begiven at this time.       </p>       <p align="left">        <u>         Results:  Fiscal 2020 versus Fiscal2019        </u>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        For fiscal 2020, the Trust'sgross royalty income decreased 51.47% to $4,050,017 from $8,344,712 infiscal 2019.  The decrease in the amount of royalty income resulted inthe lower distribution.  The total distribution for fiscal 2020 was$0.32 per unit compared to $0.82 per unit for fiscal 2019.  Gas pricesand gas sales under both royalty agreements declined significantly whilethe average exchange rates were only down slightly.  The royalty incomeattributable to gas sales under the Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2020decreased by $2,084,772 as compared to fiscal 2019.  Royalty incomeattributable to gas sales under the OEG Agreement in fiscal 2020decreased by $1,108,806 as compared to fiscal 2019.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        As in prior years, the Trustreceives adjustments from the operating companies based on their finalcalculations of royalties payable during the previous periods.  Duringfiscal 2020, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2017, 2018and 2019 decreased royalty income by $653,916.  During fiscal 2019, theadjustments based on royalties payable for 2018 increased royalty incomeby $225,450.  In fiscal 2020 and 2019, Mobil sulfur royalties totaled$71,280 and $150,157, respectively.       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        Gas sales under the MobilAgreement decreased 15.86% to 17.259 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal2020 from 20.513 Bcf in fiscal 2019.  The most significant factor resultingin the decrease in gas sales for 2020 was the negative impact of COVID-19 onthe German, European and global economies.  In addition, according to theTrust's consultant in Germany, it is likely that some portion of the declinein gas production is due to the normal reduction in well pressure that isexperienced over time.       </p>       <table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="600px">        <tbody>         <tr>          <th align="center" colspan="4" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black">           <strong>            Quarterly and YearlyGas Sales under the Mobil Agreement in Billion cubic feet           </strong>          </th>         </tr>         <tr>          <td align="left" scope="col" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;

GAAP basis financial statements discloseincome as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receiptsor payments.  The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue forexpected royalty payments.  This is exceedingly difficult since theTrust has very limited information on such payments until they arereceived and cannot accurately project such amounts.  The Trust'scash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash isreceived and expenses when cash is paid.  The one modification ofthe cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues fordistributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributionsapproved by the Trustees for the Trust).  The Trust's distributableincome represents royalty income received by the Trust during theperiod plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust,all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of themodified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unitowners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to theunit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses fortax reporting purposes.       </p>       <p align="left">        <u>         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        </u>       </p>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        The Trust has no off-balancesheet arrangements.       </p>       <hr width="300 px"/>       <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">        This Report on Form 10-K maycontain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safeharbor from liability established by the Private Securities LitigationReform Act of 1995.

The Trust does not engage in any tradingactivities with respect to commodity price fluctuations.       </p>       <p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">       </p>       <p style="page-break-after: always;">       </p>       <p style="page-break-before: always;">       </p>       <p align="left">        Item 8.        <u>         <a name="ref11">          Financial Statements and Supplementary Data         </a>        </u>        .       </p>       <p>       </p>       <center>        <u>         NORTH EUROPEAN OIL ROYALTY TRUST        </u>        <center>         <p>         </p>         <p>         </p>         <center>          <u>           INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          </u>         </center>         <p>         </p>         <table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="600px">          <tbody>           <tr>            <td align="left">            </td>            <td align="center">             <u>              Page Number             </u>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Report of Independent Registered Public AccountingFirm            </td>            <td align="center">             F-1 - F-2            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Financial Statements:            </td>            <td align="center">            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Statements of Assets, Liabilities and             <br/>             Trust Corpus as of October 31, 2020 and 2019            </td>            <td align="center" valign="bottom">             F-3            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Statements of Revenue Collected andExpenses Paid             <br/>             for the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2020 and 2019            </td>            <td align="center" valign="bottom">             F-4            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Statements of Undistributed Earnings             <br/>             for the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2020 and 2019            </td>            <td align="center" valign="bottom">             F-5            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Statements of Changes in Cash andCash Equivalents             <br/>             for the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2020 and2019            </td>            <td align="center" valign="bottom">             F-6            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr>            <td align="left">             Notes to Financial Statements            </td>            <td align="center" valign="bottom">             F-7 - F-9            </td>           </tr>          </tbody>         </table>         <p style="page-break-after: always;">         </p>         <p style="page-break-before: always;">         </p>         <p align="center">          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTINGFIRM         </p>         <p align="left">          To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of          <br/>          North European Oil Royalty Trust         </p>         <p align="left">          <strong>           Opinion on the FinancialStatements          </strong>         </p>         <p align="left">          We have audited the accompanying statements of assets,liabilities and trust corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust")as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of revenuecollected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in cash andcash equivalents, for each of the two years in the period ended October 31,2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, and itsrevenue collected and expenses paid, and changes in its cash and cash equivalentsfor each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2020, in conformitywith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.         </p>         <p align="left">          <strong>           Basis for Opinion          </strong>         </p>         <p align="left">          These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company'smanagement.

In the opinion of management, all adjustmentsthat are considered necessary for a fair presentation of thesefinancial statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurringnature, have been included.         </p>         <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">          On a modified cash basis,revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred whencash is paid.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose revenue asearned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts orpayments.  The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to permitthe accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (thosedistributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received bythe Trust during the period plus interest income less any expensesincurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of theTrustees, the use of the modified cash basis of accounting provides amore meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results ofoperations of the Trust.         </p>         <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">          The Trust receives adjustmentsfrom the operating companies based on their final calculations ofroyalties payable during the prior periods, including the immediatelypreceding calendar quarter.  Negative adjustments are carried over tothe succeeding quarter.  A negative adjustment of 444,931 Euros from thefourth quarter of fiscal 2020 will be carried over and offset againstfuture royalty revenue received in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.         </p>         <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">          <u>           Producing gas and oilroyalty rights -          </u>         </p>         <p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">          The rights to certain gasand oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at theirnet book value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (seeNote 2).
