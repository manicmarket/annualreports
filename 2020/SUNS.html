We define “middle market” to refer to companies with annual revenuestypically between $50 million and $1 billion. Our investment objective is to seek to maximize current income consistent with the preservation of capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by directly and indirectly investingprimarily in senior loans, including first lien, stretch-senior, and second lien debt instruments, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, which we refer to collectively as “senior loans.” Ourinvestments in stretch-senior loans represent loans where the amount of senior debt of the portfolio company is larger than a traditional senior secured loan but is less than a unitranche loan. We may also invest directly in the debt and equitysecurities of public companies that are thinly traded or in other equity and equity related securities and such investments may not be limited to any minimum or maximum market capitalization. In addition, we may invest in foreign markets, includingemerging markets. Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of our net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested directly or indirectly in senior loans. Senior loans typically payinterest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, primarily LIBOR, plus a premium. Senior loans in which we invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent,          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. Senior loans typically are rated below investment grade. In addition, some of ourdebt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which means that a borrower may be unable to payoff its debt due to bankruptcy or other reasons and therefore we may          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           write-off          </font>          such debtinvestment prior to its scheduled maturity. Upon such an occurrence, we may realize in a loss or a substantial amount of unpaid principal and interest due upon maturity. Securities rated below investment grade are speculative and are often referredto as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or “junk” securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. While the Company does not typically seek to investin traditional equity securities as part of its investment objective, the Company may occasionally acquire some equity securities in connection with senior loan investments and in certain other unique circumstances, such as the Company’s equityinvestments in businesses that make senior loans, including Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC (“Gemino”) and North Mill Holdco LLC (“NM Holdco”).         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We invest in senior loans made primarily to private, leveraged middle-market companies with approximately $20 million to$100 million of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).

At the same time, Solar Capital Partners takes into consideration a variety of factors in managing our portfolio and imposes portfolio-based risk constraints promoting a more diverse portfolioof investments and limiting issuer and industry concentration. We do not pursue short-term origination targets. We believe this approach enables us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the longterm.

We expect that thisinvestment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or strategic initiatives. We may also invest in the debt and equity of public companies that are thinly traded. Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the valueof our net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested directly or indirectly in senior loans.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          5         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Senior loans typically pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basisof a floating base lending rate, primarily LIBOR, plus a spread or premium. Senior loans in which we invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in variousindustries and geographical regions. Senior loans typically are rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are speculative and are often referred to as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or“junk” securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. Senior loans, however are generally less risky than subordinated debt, bearing lower leverage and higher recoverystatistics. In addition, many of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which means that a borrower may be unable to payoff its debt due to bankruptcy or other reasons and therefore we may          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           write-off          </font>          such debt investment prior to its scheduled maturity.

These investments may include similar direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States.We may invest up to 30% of our total assets in such opportunistic investments, including loans issued by          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          issuers, subject to compliance with our regulatory obligations as a BDC under the 1940 Act.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We currently borrow funds under our credit facilities and may borrow additional funds to make investments. As a result, we are exposed tothe risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for loss on amounts invested and therefore increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition,the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in management fees payable to our investment adviser, Solar Capital Partners, will be borne by our common stockholders.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Additionally, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we maycreate a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. This could include the sale of interests in the subsidiary on a          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-recourse          </font>          basis to purchasers who we would expect to bewilling to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment grade loan pools, and we would retain a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Moreover, we may acquire investments in the secondary market and, in analyzing such investments, we will employ a substantially similaranalytical process as we use for our primary investments.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options andinterest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of ourportfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those samedevelopments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible tohedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfectcorrelation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fullyor perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not entirelyrelated to currency fluctuations.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          6         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Our principal focus is to provide senior loans, including first lien and stretch-senior loans, to leveragedprivate middle-market companies in a variety of industries.

The Company generally values its assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required. Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price on the date ofvaluation. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, management determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according toGAAP to determine the fair value of the investment. If determined adequate, the Company uses the quote obtained. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium,which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under thedirection of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Investments for which reliable market quotations are notreadily available or for which the pricing sources do not provide a valuation or methodology or provide a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board does not represent fair value, each shall be valued asfollows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuations are discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser;(iii) independent valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser’s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment for (a) each portfolioinvestment that, when taken together with all other investments in the same portfolio company, exceeds 10% of estimated total assets, plus available borrowings, as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, and (b) each portfolioinvestment that is presently in payment default and the Investment Adviser does not expect to reach an agreement with the portfolio company in the subsequent quarter; (iv) the Board will discuss the valuations and determine the fair value ofeach investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where appropriate, the respective independent valuation firm.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          14         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The recommendation of fair value generally considers the following factors among others, asrelevant: applicable market yields; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company’s ability to make payments; the portfolio company’s earnings and discounted cash flow; the markets in which the issuer doesbusiness; and comparisons to publicly traded securities, among others.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          When an external event such as a purchase transaction, publicoffering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Company will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readilyavailable market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Investments are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate.

The market approach uses prices and otherrelevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation approaches to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to asingle present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricingour investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature andrealizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that arepublic, M&amp;A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. For the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2020, there has been no change to the Company’s valuation approaches or techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the followinghierarchy:         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           1          </u>          : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by theCompany at the measurement date.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           2          </u>          : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, orquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           3          </u>          : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on thelowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competitionfor investment opportunities at middle-market companies can be intense. While many middle-market companies were previously able to raise senior debt financing through traditional large financial institutions, we believe this approach to financing ismore difficult as implementation of U.S. and international financial reforms limits the capacity of large financial institutions to hold          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-investment          </font>          grade leveraged loans on their balance sheets.

Many of ourcompetitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Inaddition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and offer better pricing and a moreflexible structure than we are able to do. Furthermore, many of our potential competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. If we are unable to source attractive investments, we may hold agreater percentage of our assets in cash and cash equivalents than anticipated, which could impact potential returns on our portfolio.

However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon thesuccess of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition,deterioration in a portfolio company’s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loanis secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan’s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Equity Investments.           </i>          </b>          When we invest in senior secured loans we may acquire common equity securities as well.

High yield securities are regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal inaccordance with the terms of the obligations and involve major risk exposure to adverse conditions. In addition, high yield securities generally offer a higher current yield than that available from higher grade issues, but typically involve greaterrisk.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) ended its membership in the European Union (“Brexit”). Under the terms of the withdrawal agreementnegotiated and agreed between the UK and the European Union, the UK’s departure from the European Union was followed by a transition period (the “Transition Period”), which ran until December 31, 2020 and during which the UKcontinued to apply European Union law and was treated for all material purposes as if it were still a member of the European Union. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and UK governments signed a trade deal that became provisionallyeffective on January 1, 2021 and that now governs the relationship between the UK and European Union (the “Trade Agreement”). The Trade Agreement implements significant regulation around trade, transport of goods and travelrestrictions between the UK and the European Union. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit are unclear at this stage and are likely to continue to lead to ongoing political andeconomic uncertainty and periods of increased volatility in both the UK and in wider European markets for some time. In particular, Brexit could lead to calls for similar referendums in other European jurisdictions, which could cause increasedeconomic volatility in the European and global markets.

For example, if the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, and manufacturing facilities and factories inthe jurisdictions, including the United States, affected by the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic were to continue for an extended period of time, it could result in reduced cash flows to us from our existing portfoliocompanies, which could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders. If we violate certain covenants under our existing or future credit facilities or other leverage, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. If wedeclare a distribution and if more stockholders opt to receive cash distributions rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to sell some of our investments in order to make cash distribution payments. To the extentwe make distributions to stockholders that include a return of capital, such portion of the distribution essentially constitutes a return of the stockholder’s investment. Although such return of capital may not be taxable, such distributionswould generally decrease a stockholder’s basis in our common stock and may therefore increase such stockholder’s tax liability for capital gains upon the future sale of such stock. A return of capital distribution may cause a stockholderto recognize a capital gain from the sale of our common stock even if the stockholder sells its shares for less than the original purchase price.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          As aRIC, if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we may suffer adverse tax consequences, including possibly losing the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs.

Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the published guidance, distributions payable of a publicly offered RIC that are in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders may be treated astaxable distributions. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a revenue procedure indicating that this rule will apply if the total amount of cash to be distributed is not less than 20% of the total distribution. Under this revenue procedure, iftoo many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of distributions paid in stock). In no event will anystockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such stockholder has elected to receive in cash or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentagelimitation on cash available for distribution. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this revenue procedure that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include thefull amount of the distribution (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain distribution) to the extent ofour current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells thestock it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.

As a result, stockholders that do not participate in the dividend reinvestment plan may experience dilution over time. Stockholders who do not elect to receive distributions in shares of common stock mayexperience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount.

The issuance ofpreferred stock would likely cause the net asset value and market value of the common stock to become more volatile. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit ofleverage to the holders of the common stock would be reduced. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stockthan if we had not issued preferred stock. Any decline in the net asset value of our investments would be borne entirely by the holders of common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in agreater decrease in net asset value to the holders of common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. This greater net asset value decrease would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for thecommon stock.

For example, holders of preferredstock would vote separately from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a BDC. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote separately from holders of common stock to elect twopreferred stock directors. In the event distributions become two full years in arrears, holders of any preferred stock would have the right to elect a majority of the directors until such arrearage is completely eliminated.

Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnifythe potential for loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $0 outstanding under the Credit Facility, $5.4 million outstanding under the FLLPFacility and $85.0 million outstanding on our 2025 Unsecured Notes. We may borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders in the future. Lenders of these senior securities, including the CreditFacility, the FLLP Facility, and the 2025 Unsecured Notes will have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders, and we would expect such lenders to seek recovery against our assets in the event of adefault. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases,leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Also, anyincrease in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline moresharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could also negatively affect our ability to make distribution payments on our common stock, scheduled debt payments or other payments relating to our securities. Leverage is generallyconsidered a speculative investment technique. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, as themanagement fee payable to our investment adviser, Solar Capital Partners, will be payable based on our gross assets, including those assets acquired through the use of leverage, Solar Capital Partners will have a financial incentive to incurleverage which may not be consistent with our stockholders’ interests. In addition, our common stockholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of leverage, including any increase in the management fee payable toSolar Capital Partners.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          As a BDC, we had been required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, whichinclude all of our borrowings and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. However, our stockholders have approved a resolution permitting us to be subject to a 150% asset coverage ratio effective as of October 12,2018. Even though we are subject to a 150% asset coverage ratio effective as of October 12, 2018, contractual leverage limitations under our existing credit facilities or future borrowings may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.Some of our wholly and/or substantially owned portfolio companies, including NMC and Gemino, may incur significantly more leverage than we can but we do not consolidate NMC and Gemino and their leverage is          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-recourse          </font>          to us. Additionally, our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 150% at any time.Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could result in an event of default and all of our debt being declared immediately due and payable. If this ratio declines below 150%, we may not be able to incur additional debt and could berequired by law to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and we may not be able to make distributions. The amount of leverage that weemploy will depend on our investment adviser’s and our board of directors’ assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions would need to aggregate the amount ofindebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Section 18 of the 1940 Act when engaging in reverse repurchase agreementsor (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivative transactions under the adopted rule. Under the adopted rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to providefinancing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitmentagreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this test, it is required to treat unfunded commitments as a derivatives transaction subject to the requirements of the rule.

As a result, a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the debt investments and warrants will beallocated to the warrants that we receive. This will generally result in “original issue discount” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we must recognize as ordinary income, increasing the amount that we are required to distributeto qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits applicable to RICs. Because these warrants generally will not produce distributable cash for us at the same time as we are required to make distributions in respect of the related original issuediscount, we would need to obtain cash from other sources or to pay a portion of our distributions using shares of newly issued common stock, consistent with Internal Revenue Service requirements, to satisfy the Annual Distribution and Excise TaxAvoidance requirements.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Other features of the debt instruments that we hold may also cause such instruments to generate an original issue discount,resulting in a distribution requirement in excess of current cash interest received.

Under such circumstances, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would notconsider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources and are otherwise unable to satisfy such distributionrequirements, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on all our income.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities reflects the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that suchinvestments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and thevalue of any associated collateral. PIK interest has the effect of generating investment income and increasing the incentive fees payable at a compounding rate.

Since we mayrecognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront feesassociated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We cannotassure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          All distributions declared in cash payable tostockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are generally automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock.

In the event that shares aresold to or through underwriters, a corresponding prospectus supplement will restate this example to reflect the applicable sales load.         </p>         <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">         </p>         <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:8pt" width="92%">          <tbody>           <tr>            <td width="65%">            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="6%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="6%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="6%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="6%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr style="page-break-inside:avoid ; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:8pt">            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1.00pt solid #000000" valign="bottom">             <b>              1 Year             </b>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1.00pt solid #000000" valign="bottom">             <b>              3 Years             </b>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1.00pt solid #000000" valign="bottom">             <b>              5 Years             </b>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1.00pt solid #000000" valign="bottom">             <b>              10 Years             </b>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>           </tr>           <tr bgcolor="#cceeff" style="page-break-inside:avoid ; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">            <td valign="top">             <p style=" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1.00em; text-indent:-1.00em; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">              You would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment, assuming a 5% annual return             </p>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             $            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             59            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             $            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             176            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             $            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             290            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             $            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             567            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>           </tr>          </tbody>         </table>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           The example and the expenses in the tables above should not be considered a representation of our futureexpenses, and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown.          </b>          While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%.

We define “middle market” to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and$1 billion. Our investment objective is to seek to maximize current income consistent with the preservation of capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by directly and indirectly investing in senior loans, including first lien,stretch-senior, and second lien debt instruments, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, which we refer to collectively as “senior loans.” We may also invest in debt of public companies that arethinly traded or in equity securities. Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the value of our net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will be invested directly and indirectly in senior loans. Seniorloans typically pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, primarily LIBOR, plus a premium. Senior loans in which we invest are typically made to U.S. and, to a limited extent,          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.

In addition, some of our debt investments are not scheduled to fully amortize over their stated terms, which could cause us to suffer losses if the respective issuer of such debt investment is unable torefinance or repay their remaining indebtedness at maturity. While the Company does not typically seek to invest in traditional equity securities as part of its investment objective, the Company may occasionally acquire some equity securities inconnection with senior loan investments and in certain other unique circumstances, such as the Company’s equity investments in Gemino Healthcare Finance, LLC (“Gemino”) and North Mill Holdco LLC (“NM Holdco”).         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We invest in senior loans made primarily to private, leveraged middle-market companies with approximately $20 million to$100 million of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).

Ourdirect investments in individual securities will generally range between $5 million and $30 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or strategicinitiatives. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns.

The market approach uses prices and otherrelevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation approaches to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to asingle present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricingour investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature andrealizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that arepublic, M&amp;A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors.

PIK interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate are accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIKinvestments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as theoriginal securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at the maturity of theinvestment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-accrual          </font>          status.

Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the effective interest method. Uponthe prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees are recorded asother income when earned.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The typically higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities, to the extent we invested, reflects thepayment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accrualsrequire continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral.

If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test.

In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (          <i>           i.e.          </i>          , net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally availablefor such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We maintain an “opt out”dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders’ cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically“opt out” of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We may not be able to achieve operatingresults that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in thefuture be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually,we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have notyet received in cash, such as contractual          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            payment-in-kind           </font>          </font>          interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of theloan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investmentcompany taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          With respect to the distributions to stockholders,income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. For the fiscal years ended December 31,2020 and December 31, 2019, 18.4% and 12.3% of distributions were funded from the waiver of management and/or incentive fees.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          90         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           Related Parties          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:         </p>         <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">         </p>         <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt" width="100%">          <tbody>           <tr style="page-break-inside:avoid">            <td width="4%">            </td>            <td align="left" valign="top" width="4%">             •            </td>            <td valign="top" width="1%">            </td>            <td align="left" valign="top">             <p align="left" style=" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">              We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with Solar Capital Partners.

For example, the Investment Adviser presently serves as investment adviser to Solar Capital Ltd., a publicly traded BDC, which focuses on investing in senior secured loans, including stretch-senior loans and to a lesser extent unsecuredloans and equity securities, as well as SCP Private Income BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC that focuses primarily in senior secured loans, including asset-based loans and first lien loans and SLR HC BDC LLC, an unlisted BDC whose whose principal focus isto invest directly and indirectly in senior secured loans and other debt instruments typically to middle market companies within the healthcare industry.

Peteka, our Chief Financial Officer, serve in similar capacities for Solar CapitalLtd., SCP Private Credit Income BDC LLC and SLR HC BDC LLC. The Investment Adviser and certain investment advisory affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, dependingon the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            side-by-side           </font>          </font>          with oneor more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser’s allocation procedures. On June 13,2017, the Adviser received an exemptive order that permits the Company to participate in          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           negotiated co-investment transactions          </font>          with certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company’sinvestment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to various conditions (the “Order”). If the Company is unable to rely on the Order for aparticular opportunity, such opportunity will be allocated first to the entity whose investment strategy is the most consistent with the opportunity being allocated, and second, if the terms of the opportunity are consistent with more than oneentity’s investment strategy, on an alternating basis. Although the Adviser’s investment professionals will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, the Company and its stockholders could be adverselyaffected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of the Adviser.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Related party transactions may occur among Solar Senior Capital Ltd., Gemino and NM Holdco.

In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit marketshave experienced a higher level of stress due to the global          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in value of the securitiesthat we hold. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that asignificant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In connection with the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks havereduced certain interest rates and LIBOR has decreased. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of LIBOR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interestexpense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, certain of the investments in ourcomprehensive investment portfolio had floating interest rates. These floating rate investments were primarily based on floating LIBOR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates.Additionally, some of these investments have LIBOR floors. The Company also has revolving credit facilities that are generally based on floating LIBOR. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and no new defaults byportfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent decrease in LIBOR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our net investment income by three cents per average share over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes toour balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent increase in LIBOR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our net investment income byapproximately four cents per average share over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            time-to-time           </font>          </font>          by using standardhedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participatein any benefits of certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. At December 31, 2020, we have no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding on our balance sheet.         </p>         <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">         </p>         <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE;

Investments in allasset classes are valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. In determining the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded and whose market quotations are not readily available, the Companymakes subjective judgments and estimates using unobservable inputs. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of such investments was $341 million.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We identified the assessment of fair value of investments with no readily determinable market value and whose market quotations are not readilyavailable as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to assess the Company’s fair value methods and assumptions. Specifically, assessing the market yields used in the income approach analyses and the selection ofcomparable companies and the financial performance multiples of such comparable companies, used in the market approach analyses, required subjective auditor judgment. Additionally, the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skillsand knowledge was required to assist in evaluating the Company’s fair value estimates.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The following are the primary procedures weperformed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and implementation of certain internal controls over the Company’s process to measure fair value of investments. These included controls related to the development ofmarket yields, credit risk, and financial performance multiples assumptions. For a selection of investments, we compared the inputs and assumptions used by the Company to underlying documentation. We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimatefair value by comparing market transaction prices to the Company’s most recent fair value estimate prior to the market transaction.

GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques usedto measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fairvalue hierarchy are as follows:         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           Level          </b>          <b>          </b>          <b>           1.          </b>          Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based onunadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           Level          </b>          <b>          </b>          <b>           2.          </b>          Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

In addition, although we do not directly compensate our executive officerscurrently, to the extent that we do so in the future, the Compensation Committee would also be responsible for reviewing and evaluating their compensation and making recommendations to the board of directors regarding their compensation. Lastly, theCompensation Committee would produce a report on our executive compensation practices and policies for inclusion in our proxy statement if required by applicable proxy rules and regulations and, if applicable, make recommendations to the board ofdirectors with matters related to compensation generally. The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage compensation consultants and to delegate their duties and responsibilities to a member or to a subcommittee of the CompensationCommittee. The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Hochberg, Wachter and Potter, all of whom are considered independent under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and are not “interested persons” of the Company as that termis defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.
