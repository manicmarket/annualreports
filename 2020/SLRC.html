Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in leveragedmiddle-market companies in the form of senior secured loans, stretch-senior loans, financing leases and to a lesser extent, unsecured loans and equity securities. We define “middle market” to refer to companies with annual revenuestypically between $50 million and $1 billion. Our investments in stretch-senior loans represent loans where the amount of senior debt of the portfolio company is larger than a traditional senior secured loan but is less than a unitrancheloan. From time to time, we may also invest directly in the debt and equity of public companies that are thinly traded and such investments will not be limited to any minimum or maximum market capitalization. In addition, we may invest in foreignmarkets, including emerging markets. Our business is focused primarily on the direct origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. Our investments generally range between $5 million and $100 millioneach, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and/or with strategic initiatives.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which arenot our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall returns. These investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in selectcountries outside of the United States. The securities that we invest in are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or“junk” securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade.

We expect that this investment size will vary with thesize of our capital base and/or for strategic initiatives. Structurally, unsecured loans usually rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event ofinsolvency. However, unsecured loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers’ capital structure. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to senior loans, unsecured loans generally earn ahigher return than senior secured loans.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          In addition to senior secured loans, stretch-senior loans and unsecured loans, we may invest aportion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our returns         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          5         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          to our investors. These investments may include direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of theUnited States. The securities that we invest in are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are speculative and are often referred to as “leveraged loans,” “high yield” or “junk”securities, and may be considered “high risk” compared to debt instruments that are rated investment grade. In addition, some of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which means that a borrower may be unableto payoff its debt due to bankruptcy or other reasons and therefore we may          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           write-off          </font>          such debt investment prior to its scheduled maturity.

In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in management fees payable to our investment adviser, Solar Capital Partners, will be borne by our common stockholders.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Additionally, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments.

Hedging against a decline in the values of ourportfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those samedevelopments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible tohedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfectcorrelation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fullyor perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not relatedto currency fluctuations.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Our principal focus is to provide senior secured loans and stretch-senior loans to leveraged companies in avariety of industries.

These loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal, if any, deferred to the later years of the unsecured loans. In some cases, we may enter into loansthat, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases our unsecured loans may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or allof the assets of the borrower.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Typically, our senior secured and unsecured loans have final maturities of five to ten years.

The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into accountin fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protectionprovisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratiosof peer companies that are public, M&amp;A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors.

A repurchase agreement involves thepurchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects anagreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a singlecounterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

We compete with other BDCs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Many of ourcompetitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. Inaddition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and offer better pricing and a moreflexible structure than we are able to do. Furthermore, many of our potential competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. If we are unable to source attractive investments, we may hold agreater percentage of our assets in cash and cash equivalents than anticipated, which could impact potential returns on our portfolio. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able toidentify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Participants in our industry compete on several factors, includingprice, flexibility in transaction structure, customer service, reputation, market knowledge and speed in decision-making. We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we will offer, and we believe that some of our competitors maymake loans with interest rates that will be comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms and structure. However, if we match our competitors’pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          30         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Our investments are very risky and highly speculative.           </i>          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We invest primarily in leveraged middle-market companies in the form of senior secured loans, stretch-senior loans, financing leases and to a lesser extent,unsecured loans and equity securities.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Senior Secured Loans.           </i>          </b>          When we make a senior secured term loan investment, including stretch-seniorloan investments, in a portfolio company, we generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that we will not berepaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business andmarket conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfoliocompany’s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guaranteethat we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan’s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Unsecured Loans and Preferred Securities.           </i>          </b>          Our unsecured and preferred investments are generally subordinated to senior loans and are generallyunsecured.

In addition, we may investdirectly in the equity securities of portfolio companies without limitation as to market capitalization. For instance, we may invest in thinly traded companies, the prices of which may be subject to erratic market movement. Our goal is ultimately toexit such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from ourequity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt;

Investments purchased by us that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer of the investments, marketevents, economic conditions or investor perceptions. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly,we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) ended its membership in the European Union (“Brexit”). Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement negotiated and agreed between the UK and theEuropean Union, the UK’s departure from the European Union was followed by a transition period (the “Transition Period”), which ran until December 31, 2020 and during which the UK continued to apply European Union law and wastreated for all material purposes as if it were still a member of the European Union. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and UK governments signed a trade deal that became provisionally effective on January 1, 2021 and that nowgoverns the relationship between the UK and European Union (the “Trade Agreement”). The Trade Agreement implements significant regulation around trade, transport of goods and travel restrictions between the UK and the European Union.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit are unclear at this stage and are likely to continue to lead to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of increasedvolatility in both the UK and in wider European markets for some time. In particular, Brexit could lead to calls for similar referendums in other European jurisdictions, which could cause increased economic volatility in the European and globalmarkets.

As a result, volatility in the capital markets may have a material adverse effect on our valuations and our net asset value, even if we hold investments to maturity. Volatility or dislocation in the capital markets may depress our stockprice below our net asset value per share and create a challenging environment in which to raise equity and debt capital. These conditions could continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future. While these conditions persist, we andother companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital. Equity capital may be difficult to raise because, subject to some limited exceptions which apply to us, as a BDC weare generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. At our 2020 Annual StockholdersMeeting, our stockholders approved our ability to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock, not exceeding 25% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering, at a price or prices below the then current netasset value per share, in each case subject to the approval of our board of directors and compliance with the conditions set forth in the proxy statement pertaining thereto, during a period beginning on October 6, 2020 and expiring on theearlier of the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           one-year          </font>          anniversary of the date of the 2020 Annual Stockholders Meeting and the date of our 2021 Annual Stockholders Meeting. However, notwithstanding such stockholder approval, since ourinitial public offering on February 9, 2010, we have not sold any shares of our common stock in an offering that resulted in proceeds to us of less than our then current net asset value per share. Any offering of our common stock that requiresstockholder approval must occur, if at all, within one year after receiving such stockholder approval. In addition, our ability to incur indebtedness (including by issuing preferred stock) is limited by applicable regulations such that our assetcoverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, must equal at least 150% immediately after each time we incur indebtedness. The debt capital that will be available, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions in the future.Any inability to raise capital could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Additionally, our ability toincur indebtedness is limited by the asset coverage ratio for a BDC, as defined under the 1940 Act. Declining portfolio values negatively impact our ability to borrow additional funds because our net asset value is reduced for purposes of the assetcoverage ratio. If the fair value of our assets declines substantially, we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratio stipulated by the 1940 Act, which could, in turn, cause us to lose our status as a BDC and materially impair our businessoperations. A lengthy disruption in the credit markets could also materially decrease demand for our investments.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The significant disruption in thecapital markets experienced in the past, including the disruption caused by the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic, has had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on thepotential for liquidity events involving our investments. The debt capital that may be available to us in the future may be at a higher cost and have less favorable terms and conditions than those currently in effect. If our financing costs increaseand we have no increase in interest income, then our net investment income will decrease. A prolonged inability to raise capital may require us to reduce the volume of investments we originate and could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. This may also increase the probability that other structural risks negatively impact us.

Accordingly, to the extent we invest in“covenant-lite” loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court which would increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans.           </i>          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Courts may apply the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim or lien of a lender against a borrower to claims or liens of other creditorsof the borrower, when the lender or its affiliates is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. The courts have also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lender or its affiliates is found to have exertedinappropriate control over a client, including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in a client. We have made direct equity investments or received warrants in connection with loans. Payments on one or more of our loans,particularly a loan to a client in which we may also hold an equity interest, may be subject to claims of equitable subordination. If we were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of oneor more of our portfolio companies resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of that company, this control or influence may constitute grounds for equitable subordination and a court may treat one or more of our loans as if it were unsecuredor common equity in the portfolio company.

We may utilize instruments such as forwardcontracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging againsta decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positionsdesigned to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions shouldincrease. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we mayenter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in anysuch hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we maynot seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it maynot be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-U.S.          </font>          currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as aresult of factors not related to currency fluctuations.

To the extentwe make distributions to stockholders that include a return of capital, such portion of the distribution essentially constitutes a return of the stockholder’s investment. Although such return of capital may not be taxable, such distributionswould generally decrease a stockholder’s basis in our common stock and may therefore increase such stockholder’s tax liability for capital gains upon the future sale of such stock.

Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the published guidance, distributions payable of a publicly offered RIC that are in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders may be treated astaxable distributions. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a revenue procedure indicating that this rule will apply if the total amount of cash to be distributed is not less than 20% of the total distribution. Under this revenue procedure, iftoo many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of distributions paid in stock). In no event will anystockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such stockholder has elected to receive in cash or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentagelimitation on cash available for distribution. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this revenue procedure that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include thefull amount of the distribution (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain distribution) to the extent ofour current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells thestock it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.

If we raise additional funds by issuing morecommon stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time will decrease, and you might experience dilution. This dilution would occur as a result of aproportionately greater decrease in a stockholder’s interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. Because the number of future shares of common stock that may beissued below our net asset value per share and the price and timing of such issuances are not currently known, we cannot predict the actual dilutive effect of any such issuance.

If the valueof our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause netasset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Also, any increase in our income inexcess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would havehad we not borrowed. Such a decline could also negatively affect our ability to make distribution payments on our common stock, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculativeinvestment technique. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, as the management fee payable to ourinvestment adviser, Solar Capital Partners, will be payable based on our gross assets, including those assets acquired through the use of leverage, Solar Capital Partners will have a financial incentive to incur leverage which may not be consistentwith our stockholders’ interests.

These businesses alsomay experience substantial variations in operating results. They may face intense competition, including from companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Furthermore, some of these companies do business in regulatedindustries and could be affected by changes in government regulation. Accordingly, these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events, such as bankruptcy, which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us, and mayadversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, our investment in these companies. We cannot assure you that any of our investments in our portfolio companies will be successful.

Our board of directors utilizes the services of third-party valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of material assets. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fairvalue in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser and, when utilized, the respective third-party valuation firms. The factors that may be considered in fair value pricing our investments include the nature and realizable value of anycollateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because suchvaluations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from thevalues that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed.

The Dodd-Frank Act also created new categories of regulated market participants, such as “swap dealers,”“security-based swap dealers,” “major swap participants,” and “major security-based swap participants” who are subject to significant new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct andother regulatory requirements. The EU and some other jurisdictions are implementing similar requirements. Because these requirements are new and evolving (and some of the rules are not yet final), their ultimate impact remains unclear. However, evenif the Company itself is not located in a particular jurisdiction or directly subject to the jurisdiction’s derivatives regulations, we may still be impacted to the extent we enter into a derivatives transaction with a regulated marketparticipant or counterparty that is organized in that jurisdiction or otherwise subject to that jurisdiction’s derivatives regulations.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Based oninformation available as of the date of this annual report on Form          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           10-K,          </font>          the effect of such requirements will be likely to (directly or indirectly) increase our overall costs of entering into derivativestransactions. In particular, new margin requirements, position limits and significantly higher capital charges resulting from new global capital regulations, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivativestransactions entered into by market participants to whom such requirements apply or affect our overall ability to enter into derivatives transactions with certain counterparties. Such new global capital regulations and the need to satisfy thevarious requirements by counterparties are resulting in increased funding costs, increased overall transaction costs, and significantly affecting balance sheets, thereby resulting in changes to financing terms and potentially impacting our abilityto obtain financing. Administrative costs, due to new requirements such as registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance, even if not directly applicable to us, may also be reflected in our derivatives transactions. New requirements totrade certain derivatives transactions on electronic trading platforms and trade reporting requirements may lead to (among other things) fragmentation of the markets, higher transaction costs or reduced availability of derivatives, and/or a reducedability to hedge, all of which could adversely affect the performance of certain of our trading strategies. In addition, changes to derivatives regulations may impact the tax and/or accounting treatment of certain derivatives, which could adverselyimpact us.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          61         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          In November 2020, the SEC adopted new rules regarding the ability of a BDC (or a registered investmentcompany) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations. BDCs that use derivatives would be subject to a          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            value-at-risk           </font>          </font>          leverage limit, certain other derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements would apply unless the BDC qualified as a “limited derivatives user,” as definedin the SEC’s adopted rules. A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions would need to aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financingtransactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Section 18 of the 1940 Act when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements or (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivative transactions under theadopted rule. Under the adopted rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time itenters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this test, it is requiredto treat unfunded commitments as a derivatives transaction subject to the requirements of the rule. Collectively, these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            We may be obligated to pay our investment adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss.           </i>          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Our investment adviser will be entitled to incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           pre-incentive          </font>          fee net investment income for that quarter (before deducting incentive compensation) above a performance threshold for that quarter.

This may encourage ourinvestment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would impair the value of our common stock. In addition, our investmentadviser receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on netcapital gains. As a result, our investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities.

Under these investments, we would accrue interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income usedto calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest.

Under such circumstances, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raiseadditional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources and are otherwise unable to satisfy such distribution requirements, we may fail toqualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on all our income.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities reflects the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that suchinvestments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and thevalue of any associated collateral.

In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions.Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, includingpossible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            payment-in-kind           </font>          </font>          interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue ormarket discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as aregulated investment company.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing andcertain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          All distributions declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are generally automaticallyreinvested in shares of our common stock.

We have also included, as applicable, the estimated amortization offees incurred in establishing the Credit Facility, the NEFPASS Facility, the 2026 Unsecured Notes, the 2024 Unsecured Notes, the 2023 Unsecured Notes, the 2022 Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Tranche C Notes as of December 31, 2020.Additionally, we included the estimated cost of commitment fees for unused balances on the Credit Facility and the NEFPASS Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had $201.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, $30 millionoutstanding under our NEFPASS Facility, and $75 million, $125 million, $75 million, $150 million and $21 million outstanding under the 2026 Unsecured Notes, the 2024 Unsecured Notes, the 2023 Unsecured Notes, the 2022Unsecured Notes and the 2022 Tranche C Notes, respectively. We may also issue preferred stock, subject to our compliance with applicable requirements under the 1940 Act, although we have no immediate intention to do so.             </p>            </td>           </tr>          </tbody>         </table>         <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">         </p>         <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt" width="100%">          <tbody>           <tr style="page-break-inside:avoid">            <td align="left" valign="top" width="4%">             <sup style="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">              (8)             </sup>            </td>            <td align="left" valign="top">             <p align="left" style=" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman; ">              “Other expenses” are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year, which considers theamounts incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and include our overhead expenses, including payments under our Administration Agreement based on our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Solar CapitalManagement in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.             </p>            </td>           </tr>          </tbody>         </table>         <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           Example          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods withrespect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock.

In each case, independent valuation firmsconsider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minusamortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faithby or under the direction of our Board.

Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and/or dividends in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest/dividend cash payments are past due 30 days or more (90 days or more for equipment financing) and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest/dividend cash payments will be collected. Such          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-accrual          </font>          investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash, and in management’s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaininginterest or dividend obligations. Interest or dividend cash payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Some of our investments may have contractual PIK interest ordividends. PIK interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate are accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or inadditional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interestor dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believesPIK is not expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-accrual          </font>          status. When a PIK investment is placed on          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-accrual          </font>          status, the accrued,uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to thefair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-accrual          </font>          status are restored to accrual status if the Company again believes that PIK is expected to be realized. Loanorigination fees, original issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. Werecord prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          The typically higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities, to the extent we invested, reflects the payment deferral and increasedcredit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgmentsabout the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. PIK interest has the effect of generating investment income and increasing the incentive fees payable at a compounding rate. In addition, the deferral ofPIK interest also increases the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            loan-to-value           </font>          </font>          ratio at a compounding rate. PIK securities create the risk that incentive fees will be paid to the Investment Adviserbased on          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           non-cash          </font>          accruals that ultimately may not be realized, but the Investment Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse the Company for these fees.

If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion ofour indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of issuing senior securities,we would also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">         </p>         <p align="center" style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          89         </p>        </div>       </center>       <p style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0em; page-break-before:always">       </p>       <hr align="CENTER" size="3" style="COLOR:#999999" width="100%"/>       <h5 align="left">        <a href="#toc">         Table of Contents        </a>       </h5>       <center>        <div align="left" style="width:8.5in">         <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <b>           <i>            Senior Securities           </i>          </b>         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          Information about our senior securities is shown in the following table (in thousands) as of each year ended December 31 for the past tenyears, unless otherwise noted.

In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit marketshave experienced a higher level of stress due to the global          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in value of the securitiesthat we hold. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that asignificant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In connection with the          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           COVID-19          </font>          pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks havereduced certain interest rates and LIBOR has decreased. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, including a reduction of LIBOR to zero, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interestexpense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net interest income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, certain of the investments in ourcomprehensive investment portfolio had floating interest rates. These floating rate investments were primarily based on floating LIBOR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates.Additionally, some of these investments have LIBOR floors. The Company also has revolving credit facilities that are generally based on floating LIBOR. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and no new defaults byportfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent decrease in LIBOR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our net investment income by two cents per average share over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes toour balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one percent increase in LIBOR on our comprehensive floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our net investment income byapproximately five cents per average share over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from          <font style="white-space:nowrap">           <font style="white-space:nowrap">            time-to-time           </font>          </font>          by using standardhedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participatein any benefits of certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. At December 31, 2020, we have no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding on our balance sheet.         </p>         <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">         </p>         <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt" width="76%">          <tbody>           <tr>            <td width="79%">            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="7%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td valign="bottom" width="6%">            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>            <td>            </td>           </tr>           <tr bgcolor="#cceeff" style="page-break-inside:avoid ; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">            <td valign="top">             <p style=" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1.00em; text-indent:-1.00em; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">              Increase (Decrease) in LIBOR             </p>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             (1.00            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             %)            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             1.00            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             %            </td>           </tr>           <tr style="page-break-inside:avoid ; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt">            <td valign="top">             <p style=" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1.00em; text-indent:-1.00em; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">              Increase in Net Investment Income Per Share Per Year             </p>            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             0.02            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">            </td>            <td valign="bottom">            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             $            </td>            <td align="right" nowrap="" valign="bottom">             (0.05            </td>            <td nowrap="" valign="bottom">             )            </td>           </tr>          </tbody>         </table>         <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          We may also have exposure to foreign currencies through various investments.

The market approachuses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation approaches to convert future amounts (for example, cashflows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into accountin fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protectionprovisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratiosof peer companies that are public, M&amp;A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as aninput in the valuation process. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there has been no change to the Company’s valuation approaches or techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           1          </u>          : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at themeasurement date.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           2          </u>          : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted pricesfor identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          <u>           Level          </u>          <u>          </u>          <u>           3          </u>          : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.         </p>         <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">          In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on thelowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuations used to measurefair value into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
