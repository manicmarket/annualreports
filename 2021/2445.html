We are a leader in understanding the role of the transforming growth factor-beta, or TGF-ß, family of proteins, which are master regulators of red blood cell and platelet production as well as of the growth, repair and maintenance of muscle and bone. We have leveraged this understanding and developed a discovery approach to generate large and small molecules to address diseases of these tissues. Targeting TGF-ß signaling pathways has been clinically proven to elicit robust changes in blood cells, muscle and bone, which we believe provides a precedent and strong rationale for our strategy. Our lead protein therapeutic product candidate, KER-050, is being developed for the treatment of low blood cell counts, or cytopenias, including anemia and thrombocytopenia, in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and in patients with myelofibrosis. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MDS and reported preliminary data from Part 1 of this trial most recently in December 2021. We expect to report additional data from this ongoing trial in mid-2022. We have also commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with myelofibrosis and expect to report initial data from this trial by the end of 2022. Our lead small molecule product candidate, KER-047, is being developed for the treatment of anemia resulting from iron imbalance. We have completed our Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-047 and expect to commence two open-label Phase 2 clinical trials in the first half of 2022, one in patients with iron deficiency anemia, or IDA, and one in patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, or IRIDA. Our third product candidate, KER-012, is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and for the treatment of disorders associated with bone loss, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. We have commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-012 in healthy volunteers and expect to report initial data from Part 1 of this trial in the second quarter of 2022. We believe KER-047 and KER-012 offer substantial opportunities for us to continue to apply our understanding of TGF-ß signaling pathways and expand our development programs in related hematological and musculoskeletal disorders with high unmet medical need.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">KER-050 is an engineered ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of the TGF-ß receptor known as activin receptor type IIA, or ActRIIA, that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-050 is designed to increase red blood cell and platelet production by inhibiting the signaling of a subset of the TGF-ß family of proteins to promote hematopoiesis. We believe KER-050 has the potential to provide benefit to patients suffering from red blood cell and platelet differentiation and maturation defects occurring across the spectrum from early through terminal stages of hematopoiesis, and consequently may be effective for many patients that have limited treatment options or are refractory to available therapies. Based on data from our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-050 in healthy volunteers and from our preclinical studies, we believe KER-050 has a differentiated pharmacologic effect on red blood cells and platelets and has the potential to treat multiple cytopenias in diseases of ineffective hematopoiesis. In December 2021, we announced additional preliminary results from Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-050 for the treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with very low-, low-, or intermediate-risk MDS. We expect to report additional data from this trial in mid-2022. Additionally, in December 2021, we commenced an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KER-050 for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias and expect to report initial data from this trial by the end of 2022.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">KER-047 is designed to selectively and potently inhibit activin receptor-like kinase-2, or ALK2, a TGF-ß receptor. We believe that KER-047 has the potential to ameliorate excessive ALK2 signaling, which is directly implicated in anemias arising from iron imbalance. We are developing KER-047 for the treatment of anemia resulting from iron imbalance as a direct consequence of elevated ALK2 signaling, including our initial target, IRIDA. In December 2020, we reported topline data from our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-047 in healthy volunteers. We expect to commence two open-label Phase 2 clinical trials in the first half of 2022, one in patients with IDA and one in patients with IRIDA, and expect to report initial data from both trials by the end of 2022.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">KER-012 is designed to bind to and inhibit the signaling of TGF-ß ligands that suppress bone growth, including activin A and activin B, to potentially promote bone growth. We believe that KER-012 has the potential to increase the signaling of bone morphogenic protein, or BMP, pathways through this inhibition of activin A and activin B signaling, and consequently treat diseases such as PAH that are associated with reduced BMP signaling due to inactivating mutations in the BMP receptors. We are developing KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and for the treatment of disorders associated with bone loss, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. In a rat model of PAH, a rodent version of KER-012, or RKER-012, reduced PAH-associated inflammation, fibrosis and vascular remodeling was observed.  Furthermore, KER-012 did not increase red blood cell production in non-human primates, indicating a lack of a potential dose-limiting red blood cell side effect. Additionally, in a pulmonary arterial banding, or PAB, mouse model of right ventricle overload, mice receiving RKER-012 did not have the changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling exhibited in the PAB mice that received vehicle. These data support that RKER-012 has a cardio-protective mechanism of action that could potentially provide benefit in diseases such as PAH and other cardiovascular diseases. In addition, rats receiving RKER-012 were protected from PAH-associated bone loss, which we believe demonstrates proof-of-mechanism of KER-012 for the treatment of PAH and bone loss. In September 2021, we commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-012 in healthy volunteers and expect to report initial data from Part 1 of this trial in the second quarter of 2022 and additional data from Part 2 of this trial in the second half of 2022.</span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">1</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our strategy focuses on the role of members of the TGF-ß family of proteins in the development of blood cells, muscle and bone.

In the United States, there are 60,000 to 170,000 patients with MDS and 15,000 to 20,000 new cases of MDS reported each year. MDS predominantly affects older adults, with approximately 75% of patients aged 60 years or older at diagnosis. Median survival ranges from approximately nine years for very&nbsp;low-risk&nbsp;patients to less than a year for high-risk patients.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Cytopenias in MDS are caused by defects occurring across the various stages of hematopoiesis, from the self-renewal of progenitor cells to differentiation in early through terminal stages. Anemia is the most frequent consequence of ineffective hematopoiesis in patients with MDS due to low red blood cell production, and impacts 90% of MDS patients, with approximately 40% becoming transfusion dependent. Another consequence is thrombocytopenia, a deficiency of platelets in the blood, which is impaired blood clotting that can cause bleeding. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia in patients with MDS has been reported at 40% to 65%. A deficiency of neutrophils in the blood, or neutropenia, also increases the risk of serious infections in patients with MDS and has been reported to affect approximately 20% of patients with MDS.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To guide decisions on risk stratification and the treatment of patients with MDS, clinicians typically use the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised, or the&nbsp;IPSS-R.&nbsp;The&nbsp;IPSS-R&nbsp;incorporates information on bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype and presence and severity of cytopenias in order to classify patients with MDS into groups based on the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, ranging from very&nbsp;low-risk&nbsp;to high-risk.

The WHO classification system includes a subgroup of patients with MDS that show the presence of iron deposits around the mitochondria, known as ring sideroblasts. These patients are commonly referred to as RS positive and comprise approximately 15% of incident patients with MDS, and splicing factor mutations, such as&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">SF3B1</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">,&nbsp;are highly correlated with these patients. Patients with splicing factor mutations often have been observed to have defects in the differentiation of red blood cells at the terminal stage.

These non-RS patients have differentiation and maturation defects occurring across the spectrum from early through terminal stages of hematopoiesis.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Cytopenias in Patients with MDS</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Patients with&nbsp;MDS-associated&nbsp;anemia are generally treated with red blood cell transfusions and erythroid stimulating agents, or ESAs, which are not approved for such treatment.

Red blood cell and platelet transfusions provide temporary benefits to patients with MDS, but are associated with both acute and chronic health risks, including risk of bacterial infection and allergic reactions to the donor blood, and place a significant burden on both the patient and the healthcare system. Red blood cell transfusions are also associated with iron overload, which can lead to organ dysfunction over time. Additionally, the benefit from a platelet transfusion is typically short-lived and availability is limited. Platelet-stimulating agents for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, which are not currently indicated for MDS, carry the risk of thromboembolic events and bone marrow fibrosis.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">ESAs are a class of drugs that work on the proliferation stage of red blood cell development by expanding the pool of early-stage progenitor cells. While ESAs have been shown to alleviate anemia in a subset of patients with MDS, patients that have elevated endogenous erythropoietin levels are unlikely to respond. In two controlled Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) and epoetin alpha (Epogen/Procrit) for the treatment of&nbsp;MDS-associated&nbsp;anemia, 15% to 31% of patients responded, respectively. However, this response was limited to patients with low endogenous erythropoietin levels at baseline and to patients who had a low transfusion burden at baseline. These treatment options also represent a significant burden to patients; epoetin alpha must be administered up to three times a week. Additionally, the effect of ESAs is limited to the red blood cell lineage and, therefore, ESAs only treat&nbsp;MDS-associated&nbsp;anemia and do not provide benefit to cytopenia of other cell lineages, including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Reblozyl, a&nbsp;TGF-ß-based&nbsp;erythroid maturation agent, is designed to promote the terminal differentiation of red blood cells through inhibition of selected endogenous&nbsp;TGF-ß&nbsp;superfamily ligands.

Myelofibrosis&nbsp;is characterized by ineffective&nbsp;hematopoiesis, an enlarged spleen, bone marrow fibrosis and shortened survival. Patients often experience multiple disease-associated and treatment-emergent cytopenias, including anemia and thrombocytopenia.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The ineffective hematopoiesis in myelofibrosis is driven by molecular abnormalities in the Janus kinase 2, or JAK2,&nbsp;-signal&nbsp;transducers and activators of transcription, or&nbsp;JAK-STAT,&nbsp;signaling pathway of transcriptional activators. Specifically, JAK2 activation leads to proliferation of red blood cell progenitors and platelet progenitors, or megakaryocytes, that fail to mature to platelets.&nbsp;Additionally, megakaryocyte dysplasia/hyperplasia has been implicated in inducing bone marrow fibrosis in patients with myelofibrosis. The inability of megakaryocytes to fully differentiate leads to the release of&nbsp;pro-inflammatory&nbsp;and&nbsp;pro-fibrotic&nbsp;factors that results in scarring of the bone marrow, which further exacerbates the myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition with an identified prevalence of 16,000 to 18,500 patients in the United States. Approximately 3,000 new patients are diagnosed with myelofibrosis each year, and the median age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options to address the myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias. Within a year of diagnosis, 38% of patients with myelofibrosis are red blood cell transfusion dependent and eventually nearly all will develop transfusion dependence. Additionally, within a year of diagnosis, 26% of patients with myelofibrosis will develop thrombocytopenia and 51% will develop anemia.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Cytopenias in Patients with Myelofibrosis</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There are no approved pharmacological treatments for myelofibrosis-associated cytopenias.

In a third-party Phase 3 clinical trial of Jakafi and a third-party Phase 3 clinical trial of Inrebic, treatment led to significant reductions in spleen volume and improvement in total symptom scores. However, JAK inhibitors interfere with normal hematopoiesis and treatment with Jakafi and Inrebic also resulted in clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia in these Phase 3 trials. Approximately 45% of patients in the Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Jakafi developed treatment-related grade&nbsp;3 or 4 anemia. Grade&nbsp;3 or higher adverse events of anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in approximately 34% and 12%, respectively, of patients evaluated in the Phase 3 clinical trial of Inrebic.

Although iron is required for many functions in the body, including erythropoiesis, high iron levels are toxic, so circulating levels are regulated to avoid iron overload. To maintain this balance, absorption of dietary iron is tightly controlled and recycled iron is held in the liver and macrophages, which we refer to as the storage tissues, to be mobilized quickly when circulating iron levels are too low. These storage tissues also act to sequester away iron when levels are too high. Hepcidin, a hormone produced by the liver, is the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, and controls both the recirculation of iron from storage tissues as well as the absorption of dietary iron from the intestine.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Hepcidin levels are upregulated through activation of the ALK2 receptor, which is a BMP receptor belonging to the broader&nbsp;TGF-ß&nbsp;family of proteins. Hepcidin levels are tightly regulated by liver cells through BMP6 signaling via ALK2. High serum iron triggers the expression of BMP6, which then acts to increase hepcidin expression, resulting in iron sequestration, decreased iron absorption and reduced serum iron. Hepcidin&nbsp;is controlled by a feedback loop, and serum&nbsp;hepcidin&nbsp;levels are inversely related to serum iron levels. This feedback loop prevents this system from shifting out of balance. The system is down regulated through the activity of matriptase-2, or MT-2, a cell surface protease, which is encoded by the TMPRSS6 </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">16</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">gene.

However, the association of mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene with IRIDA was not identified until 2008, and genetic testing for IRIDA is not widely available. Furthermore, affected individuals usually have normal growth and development, so IRIDA is poorly diagnosed.

Patients with chronic inflammation have mild to moderate anemia resulting from low serum iron that is driven by abnormally high hepcidin levels through sustained cytokine-mediated ALK2 activation. Anemia of inflammation is the second most common cause of anemia worldwide. The prevalence of anemia varies among different inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In the United States, approximately 1,000,000 people older than age 65 suffer from diseases of chronic inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ankylosing spondylitis. Anemia with high hepcidin levels has also been reported in patients with primary myelofibrosis.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Limitations of Current Treatment Options for Anemia Arising from Iron Imbalance, including IRIDA</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There are no current treatments that address the underlying cause of anemia arising from iron imbalance, including in patients with IDA associated with co-morbidities and in patients with IRIDA. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Currently, there are two common methods of iron therapy used to treat IDA: oral iron supplements and IV iron. While oral iron supplements are used as first-line iron replacement therapy for most patients, they are poorly absorbed and not well tolerated by some patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness. The beneficial effect of oral iron supplements on increasing hemoglobin levels can require an extended treatment period, and, at times, treatment is inadequate to achieve the targeted hemoglobin levels. Conversely, iron administered by IV infusion allows larger amounts of iron to be delivered to patients in a shorter time frame, which can result in faster rises in hemoglobin levels. However, for patients with IDA associated with co-morbidities, neither of these treatments address the underlying cause of the disease. Additionally, these treatments can also cause mild side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea and cramping, and can increase the risk of very serious, life-threatening side effects, such as hypersensitivity reactions, opportunistic infections and the deposition of excess iron in organs in patients with co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Separately, patients with anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis that require frequent red blood cell transfusions may have elevated levels of hepcidin with accompanying iron overload in multiple organ systems. This chronic iron overload can lead to multiple organ dysfunction, including in the liver, heart and endocrine. Accordingly, iron chelation therapy is used to reduce iron deposits in those organs. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">According to a 2021 GlobalInfoResearch report, the global iron chelation market was estimated to be $1.1 billion in 2019, approximately 82% of which was associated with the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload.

By ameliorating anemia arising from iron imbalance, we believe&nbsp;KER-047&nbsp;can potentially eliminate the need for excessive supplementary iron or IV iron treatments and avoid the adverse events associated with those treatment options. In addition, we believe KER-047, if approved, has the potential to be beneficial in diseases of iron overload by mobilizing excess iron being stored in tissues into the serum. By ameliorating the excess iron in tissues, we believe KER-047 can potentially eliminate or reduce the need for phlebotomy and/or treatment with iron chelators, while allowing patients to avoid the adverse events associated with these treatments and providing benefit to patients where the current treatment options are largely ineffective. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In August 2020, we announced the completion of our planned single and multiple ascending dose cohorts in a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-047 in healthy volunteers, as well as the expansion of this trial to evaluate additional cohorts of healthy volunteers.

We confirmed that mice receiving the TMPRSS6 siRNA had a greater than 85% reduction of target gene expression relative to the control siRNA cohort. This model recapitulated the increased hepcidin levels and reduced hemoglobin that are characteristic of patients with IRIDA.

Likewise, the finding that the mouse models with changes in ALK2 signaling recapitulate human disease also provides evidence that the function of the ALK2 receptor is conserved across species. For example, knockdown of the TMPRSS6 gene results in a phenocopy of the disease observed in patients with IRIDA. We believe that the conservation of biology provides confidence that treatments that are efficacious in preclinical models will have similar effects in humans.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We further explored the results we observed in a mouse model of IRIDA by using a mouse model of anemia of inflammation via induced chronic kidney disease. Inflammatory cytokines in chronic kidney diseases results in increased hepcidin, iron imbalance and anemia, and we believe a mouse model of chronic kidney disease is predictive of the broader indication of anemia of inflammation. To generate this mouse model, mice were dosed daily for six weeks with 50 mg/kg of adenine to induce kidney damage, and subsequently developed inflammation-mediated anemia, with corresponding elevated levels of hepcidin and decreased serum iron. Thereafter, mice continued to receive either vehicle or adenine daily, but also received daily treatment of either vehicle or 5 mg/kg of an ALK2 inhibitor closely related to KER-047 for ten days. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">At termination of the preclinical study, mice receiving adenine in combination with the ALK2 inhibitor had serum iron values 108.2% higher than the vehicle-treated mice receiving adenine and vehicle.

These data substantiate the role of ALK2 signaling in anemia arising from high hepcidin and illustrate the potential therapeutic benefit of specific ALK2 inhibition in these diseases, including anemia of inflammation.</span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_34"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our Musculoskeletal and Pulmonary Program</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_37"></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">KER-012</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">KER-012 is a ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of ActRIIB that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-012 is designed to bind to and inhibit the signaling of TGF-ß ligands, including activin A and activin B, which are key regulators of bone remodeling that act to suppress bone growth, to potentially increase bone mass. We believe that KER-012 has the potential to increase the signaling of BMP pathways through this inhibition of activin A and activin B signaling, and consequently treat diseases such as PAH that are associated with reduced BMP signaling due to inactivating mutations in the BMP receptors. We are developing KER-012 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and for the treatment of disorders associated with bone loss, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. We have commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-012 in healthy volunteers and expect to report initial data from Part 1 of this trial in the second quarter of 2022 and additional data from Part 2 of this trial in the second half of 2022.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">PAH is a debilitating disorder characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to severe constriction and progressive obliteration of the pulmonary vessels. PAH results in diminished oxygenation, impaired cardiac output and symptoms stemming from overload of the right ventricle, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, fainting, chest pain, palpitations and swelling of extremities and abdomen. We estimate that there are approximately 40,000 addressable patients in the United States living with this condition. Despite current treatment options, survival with PAH remains only slightly above 50% at five years, with mortality typically resulting from right ventricle failure.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the BMP type II receptor, or BMPR2, are present in over 70% of cases of heritable PAH, or HPAH, while loss-of-function mutations in certain BMPR2 co-receptors are present in other cases of HPAH and idiopathic PAH. Histology and gene expression studies from the lungs of human and experimental PAH showed diminished BMPR2 expression and BMP signaling even in the absence of loss-of-function mutations, as well as enhanced TGF-ß signaling. Consistent with an imbalance in the signaling of these families of ligands, it was recently found that PAH due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension is marked by a severe deficiency of circulating BMP9, while circulating TGF-ß, activin and growth differentiation factor, or GDF, ligands were found to be increased in PAH, even in the absence of causative mutations. Multiple experimental third-party models also demonstrated the efficacy of augmenting BMP signaling or suppressing TGF-ß, activin or GDF signaling, which we believe supports the notion that imbalanced homeostatic BMP and pathogenic TGF-ß, activin and GDF signaling drive the development and progression of pulmonary vascular disease.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt;padding-left:18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Limitations of Current Treatment Options for PAH</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">All of the currently-approved therapies for PAH are vasodilators, which are medications that dilate blood vessels. These vasodilators fall into one of three categories: (i) prostanoids, which are agonists of the prostacyclin signaling pathway; (ii) endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERAs; or (iii) (a) phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, or PDE5i, which are agents that enhance nitric oxide metabolism, or (b) soluble guanylate cyclase activators, which cause downstream cGMP signaling.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">One common approach to treating early-stage or mild PAH is an oral combination therapy using ERA and PDE5i medications. More severe PAH generally requires the addition of prostanoid, via oral or inhaled administration, while advanced PAH typically requires continuous parenteral administration.

Accordingly, we believe there is a significant unmet need for a treatment that primarily targets the proliferative pathological processes and can be used alone or in combination with other PAH therapies.

It is also estimated that 50% of women and 20% of men over the age of 50 will suffer at least one osteoporosis-related fracture in their remaining lifetime. These fractures can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

However, bisphosphonates have limited efficacy for non-vertebral fractures, and gains in bone mineral density have been observed to plateau after a few years of treatment. Additionally, bisphosphonate use has been associated with infrequent but serious adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. These side effects, although rare, have created increasing concern among physicians and patients. Accordingly, the number of bisphosphonate prescriptions has declined over 50% in the last decade and physicians are seeking alternatives.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There are several alternatives to bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, including anti-resorptive agents and anabolic agents. The most potent anti-resorptive product that is approved for treatment is Prolia (denosumab). Given twice a year via subcutaneous injection by a physician, Prolia increases bone density and reduces hip, spine and non-vertebral fractures. However, in the past five years, there have been numerous reports about fractures, especially those of the spine, occurring after the cessation of Prolia, which we believe has caused many patients with osteoporosis to refrain from commencing treatment with Prolia.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Anabolic therapies approved for treatment of osteoporosis include Forteo (teriparatide) and Tymlos (abaloparatide). Delivered by daily subcutaneous injection, these products have been observed to improve bone density and reduce vertebral fractures, but have limited evidence for reduction of hip fracture, which is frequently a debilitating fracture for patients. Additionally, use of these products is restricted to two years and their labels include a black-box warning regarding the occurrence of bone cancer in rats treated with Forteo, which is a key deterrent to using these products for many patients.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg), an anabolic therapy, increases bone formation briefly while also reducing bone resorption. The reason for the short-term nature of the anabolic effect is unclear. Evenity is delivered via two subcutaneous injections monthly at a doctor’s office, with use restricted to 12 months. Although Evenity exhibited robust anti-fracture efficacy and large gains in bone mineral density in a third-party Phase 3 clinical trial, the Evenity label includes a black-box warning that the product may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from a cardiovascular event.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We believe there is a large unmet need for patients with osteoporosis, as existing therapies have shortcomings in efficacy, tolerability, convenience and safety.

In preclinical studies, KER-012 bound to and inhibited multiple ligands that signal through these cell surface receptors, including activin A, activin B and growth differentiation factor 11. These ligands are key regulators of bone remodeling that act to suppress bone growth. BMP9 is a ligand capable of signaling through the ActRIIB and bone morphogenetic receptor II. Inhibition of BMP9 results in disruption of vascular remodeling, which can lead to the development of epistaxis and telangiectasias.

Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND submission contains the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as results of in vitro and animal studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. These investigators are generally physicians who are not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety and assessing efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the existing IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.

If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Human clinical trials in the United States are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition.

The application must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.

The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product application also includes a non-orphan indication. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing.

Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to review standard applications within ten months from the filing date, during which it will complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, or within six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective, or for a biologic, safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA or BLA if the trials were conducted under an IND, and the IND requirements, unless waived, were met. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA or BLA if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the trials were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.

The FDA is not bound by recommendations of the advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be manufactured, the FDA will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the application in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, which may include the potential requirement for additional clinical studies, including the potential requirement to conduct additional clinical trial(s) and/or to complete other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition.

Further, after approval, if there are any changes or modifications to the approved product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA review and approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product.

Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and others on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> qui tam </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the civil False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.

Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by  the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, as well as their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made in the prior year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws which require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws which require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">40</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">the privacy and security of health information which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Healthcare Reform </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which started on January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">41</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.

These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Another sequester, the PAYGO Sequester, effective with the passage of the American Rescue Plan, will add another 4% reduction in Medicare spending in 2023, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures as part of the other reform measures.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives.  For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Additional Regulation </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business.

Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical development process. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization. We may be unable to establish clinical endpoints that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful, and a clinical trial can fail at any stage of testing. Further, the process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, as well as the target indications, patient population and regulatory agency. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize KER-050, KER-047, KER-012 and any future product candidates in the United States or abroad, we, our collaborators or our potential future collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Clinical trials that we conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If the results of our ongoing or future clinical trials are inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of our product candidates, if we do not meet the clinical endpoints with statistical and clinically meaningful significance, or if there are safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval, if at all. Additionally, any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if the trials are successfully completed, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and we cannot guarantee that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. We cannot guarantee that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will view our product candidates as having efficacy even if positive results are observed in clinical trials. Moreover, results acceptable to support approval in one jurisdiction may be deemed inadequate by another regulatory authority to support regulatory approval in that other jurisdiction. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of KER-050, KER-047, KER-012 and any future product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Even if regulatory approval is secured for a product candidate, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of the specific product candidate, which may also limit its commercial potential. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates. There is a high failure rate for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks.

For example, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for KER-050 in patients with MDS is an open-label trial. An “open-label” clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved product or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. For example, in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for KER-050 in patients with MDS, the dose levels for Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are 0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3.75 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Open-label clinical trials are also subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a “patient bias” where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Moreover, patients selected for early-stage clinical trials often include the most severe sufferers and their symptoms may have been bound to improve notwithstanding the new treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an “investigator bias” where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. Given that open-label Phase 2 clinical trials are ongoing for KER-050 and planned for KER-047, the results from these clinical trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with these or other product candidates for which we include an open-label clinical trial when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our product candidates may be associated with serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects or other properties or safety risks, which may delay or halt their clinical development, or prevent marketing approval.

In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications.

As a result, we have encountered difficulties enrolling participants in our planned clinical trial evaluating KER-047 for the treatment of IRIDA due, in part, to the small size of this patient population. In addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Delays related to patient enrollment and difficulties related to patient retention may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our future clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">From time to time, we may publish interim, topline or preliminary data from our clinical trials.

The acceptance of trial data by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority from clinical trials conducted outside of their respective jurisdictions may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice, (ii) the trials are performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to compliance with current GCP requirements and (iii) the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate mean. Additionally, the FDA’s clinical trial requirements, including the adequacy of the patient population studied and statistical powering, must be met. In addition, such foreign trials are subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of its applicable jurisdiction.

Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the other company’s product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We believe that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once licensed, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products, our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We may become exposed to costly and damaging liability claims, either when testing our product candidates in the clinic or at the commercial stage, and our product liability insurance may not cover all damages from such claims. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and use of biopharmaceutical products.

Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular proprietary molecules in our library, product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain product development programs may also prove not to be optimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the market potential of our product candidates or misread trends in the biopharmaceutical industry, in particular for our lead product candidates, KER-050, KER-047, as well as for KER-012, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We may seek orphan drug designation for product candidates we develop, and we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As part of our business strategy, we may seek orphan drug designation for any product candidates we develop, and we may be unsuccessful. While we have not made a determination regarding whether we intend to seek orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates at this time, we may do so in the future. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards certain clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Generally in the United States, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug and indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different therapies can be approved for the same condition and the same therapies can be approved for different conditions but used off-label. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. While we may seek orphan drug designation for applicable indications for our current and any future product candidates, we may never receive such designations. Even if we do receive such designations, there is no guarantee that we will benefit from those designations. </span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_73"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we are unable to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we are successful in obtaining marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities for KER-050, KER-047, KER-012 or any other product candidate, our ability to generate revenues from any such products will depend on our success in: </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">launching commercial sales of such products, whether alone or in collaboration with others;

Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly as they develop novel approaches to treating disease indications that our product candidates are also focused on treating. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel therapeutics or to in-license novel therapeutics that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, convenience of use, price and reimbursement. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We compete in the segments of the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other related industries that develop and market therapies for the treatment of hematological and musculoskeletal disorders. There are many other companies, including large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, that have commercialized and/or are developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that our product candidates target. For example, FibroGen Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are developing product candidates for the treatment of anemia, and Acceleron Pharma Inc. (which was acquired by Merck &amp; Co. Inc. in November 2021), or Acceleron, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Disc Medicine are developing product candidates targeting diseases associated with MDS and myelofibrosis, including chronic anemia. Additionally, in April 2020, Acceleron received FDA approval of its product, Reblozyl, for the treatment of anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring two or more red blood cell units over eight weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. In June 2020, Acceleron further announced that the European Commission approved Reblozyl for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in adult patients with MDS or beta thalassemia and in September 2020, Acceleron announced that Health Canada approved Reblozyl for the treatment of adult patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent anemia associated with beta thalassemia.

In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA, those of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following: </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">an annual, non-deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents (other than those designated as orphan drugs), which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">a licensure framework for follow on biologic products; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">establishment of a Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA.  For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to additional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures as part of the other reform measures.  In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">59</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December  27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles.  No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of the budget reconciliation process. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates or put pressure on our product pricing. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In markets outside of the United States, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">60</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, in recent years, including in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may continue to adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Sales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval will depend substantially, both in the United States and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize an adequate return on our investment. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. This process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.

Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Furthermore, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for products administered under the supervision of a physician may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, medical product prices are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a product receives marketing approval. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In general, product prices under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any future product candidates from third-party payors, the adoption of those products and sales revenue will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect the ability to market or sell those product candidates, if approved.

Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. </span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_76"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property.

Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees.

Under the enacted Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, enacted in 2013, the United States moved from a “first to invent” to a “first-to-file” system. Under a “first-to-file” system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently developed new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the “first-to-file” provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.

Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements, or restrictions on our ability to freely assign or sublicense our rights under such agreements when it is in the interest of our business to do so, may impede, delay or prohibit the further development or commercialization of one or more product candidates that rely on such agreements. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We may have limited control over the maintenance and prosecution of these in-licensed patents and patent applications, activities or any other intellectual property that may be related to our in-licensed intellectual property.

In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures.

Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using any of our trade secrets, we may incur substantial costs. These lawsuits may consume our time and other resources even if we are successful. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, post grant review, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to our product candidates and programs. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of drugs, products or their methods of use or manufacture. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If a third-party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to: </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management’s attention from our core business; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner’s attorneys’ fees; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">a court prohibiting us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling our product candidates, or from using our proprietary technologies, unless the third party licenses its product rights to us, which it is not required to do; </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and other amounts, and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">redesigning our product candidates or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.

Generally, conducting clinical trials and other development activities in the United States is protected under the Safe Harbor exemption as set forth in 35 U.S.C. § 271. If and when KER-050, KER-047, KER-012 or another one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, that certain third party may then seek to enforce its patent by filing a patent infringement lawsuit against us. While we do not believe that any claims of such patent that could otherwise materially adversely affect commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, are valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief, or we may not be able to prove it in a litigation. In this regard, patents issued in the United States by law enjoy a presumption of validity that can be rebutted only with evidence that is “clear and convincing,” a heightened standard of proof. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. Even if we obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Even if such a license is available, it may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all.

These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers or distributors, or may be required to obtain licenses for the product candidates or services they use.

While an inadvertent lapse, including due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or our licensors’ patent maintenance vendors, can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents.

In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and product candidates. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, the patents included in our patent portfolio may expire before, or soon after, our first product achieves marketing approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions.

Upon the expiration of our current or future owned or licensed patents, we may lose the right to exclude others from practicing these inventions. The expiration of these patents could also have a similar material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We own pending patent applications covering our proprietary technologies or our product candidates that if issued as patents are expected to expire from 2037 through 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions.

Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or in ex-U.S. jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the case </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Amgen Inc. v.

Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, subject us to expenditure of resources with respect to reporting requirements and limit our ability to contract with foreign manufacturers. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">At least one of our in-licensed patent cases related to our KER-047 product candidate has been funded in part by the U.S. government and, therefore, is subject to certain federal regulations pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or the Bayh-Dole Act, and it is possible that additional patent filings we may choose to in-license in the future may also be subject to similar regulations. In particular, the federal government retains a “nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license” for its own benefit to inventions produced with its financial assistance. The Bayh-Dole Act also provides federal agencies with “march-in rights.” March-in rights allow the government, in specified circumstances, to require the contractor or successors in title to the patent to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.” If the patent owner refuses to do so, the government may grant the license itself. Intellectual property discovered under government-funded programs are also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or our licensors to expend substantial resources. Such intellectual property is also subject to a preference for U.S. industry, which may limit our ability to contract with foreign product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. Moreover, we sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development. While it is our policy to avoid engaging our university partners in projects in which there is a risk that federal funds may be commingled, we cannot be sure that any co-developed intellectual property will be free from government rights pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act. Further, we may choose to license intellectual property in the future that may be subject to government rights pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act. If, in the future, we co-own or license in technology which is critical to our business that is developed in whole or in part with federal funds subject to the Bayh-Dole Act, our ability to enforce or otherwise exploit patents covering such technology may be adversely affected. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. Also, competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States.

If we, or our licensors, later sue such third party for patent infringement, the third party may have certain legal defenses available to it, which otherwise would not be available except for the delay between when the infringement was first detected and when the suit was brought. Such legal defenses may make it impossible for us or our licensors to enforce our owned or in-licensed patents, as the case may be, against such third party. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If another party questions the patentability of any of our claims in our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents, the third-party can request that the USPTO review the patent claims such as in an</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> inter partes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> review, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">ex parte</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> re-exam or post-grant review proceedings.

The costs of these opposition or similar proceedings could be substantial, and may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent.

In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions such as patent term adjustments and/or extensions, may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">71</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially harmed. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984 Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed. Further, for our licensed patents, we may not have the right to control prosecution, including filing with the USPTO, of a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of our licensed patents is eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we may not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension is filed, or obtained, from the USPTO. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks.

We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our third-party contractors and CROs are required to comply with good laboratory practices, or GLPs, as applicable, and GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible, reproducible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these GLPs and GCPs through periodic inspections of laboratories conducting GLP studies, trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we, our investigators or any of our CROs or contracted laboratories fail to comply with applicable GLPs and GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials comply with applicable GLP or GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product, including biologic product, produced in compliance with applicable cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Further, these laboratories, investigators and CROs are not our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time, which they devote to our product candidates and clinical trials.

If laboratories, CROs or clinical investigators do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our preclinical or clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.

The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates are subject to review by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or BLA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of drug and biologic products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates manufactured at these manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if any agency withdraws its approval in the future, we and they may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact the ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. The failure of our manufacturers to comply with regulatory requirements could also result in an enforcement action against us, including the seizure of products and shutting down of production. If any of our third-party suppliers fails to comply with cGMP or other applicable manufacturing regulations, our ability to develop and commercialize the products could suffer significant interruptions. We face risks inherent in relying on a single CMO, as any disruption, such as a fire, natural hazards or vandalism at the CMO could significantly interrupt our manufacturing capability. All of our CMOs currently do not have alternative production plans in place or disaster-recovery facilities available. In case of a disruption, we will have to establish alternative manufacturing sources. This would require substantial capital on our part, which we may not be able to obtain on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, we would likely experience months of manufacturing delays as the CMO builds or locates replacement facilities and seeks and obtains necessary regulatory approvals.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Massachusetts ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses effective March 24, 2020, through April 7, 2020, which was subsequently extended through May 18, 2020. On May 29, 2021, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts permitted all industries to fully re-open and on June 15, 2021, the governor of Massachusetts signed an executive order that terminated the Commonwealth's State of Emergency. Because of the nature of our operations, we are considered to be an essential business so, to date, our operations have only been partially affected by these orders. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the spread of COVID-19, we have closed our principal executive office in March 2020, with our administrative employees continuing their work outside of our office, and limited the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory. In July 2021, we implemented a plan to reopen our office to allow employees to return to the office, which is based on a phased approach that is principles-based and local in design, with a focus on continuity of preclinical studies and clinical trial activities, employee safety and optimal work environment. If COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and other countries, particularly in light of variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including: </span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">▪</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.64pt">delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;

The inability to recruit, or the loss of services of certain executives, key employees, consultants or advisors, may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As of December 31, 2021, we had 60 full-time employees, including 45 employees engaged in research and development and 15 employees engaged in management or general and administrative activities.

Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our future CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or unauthorized access or use resulting from computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, hacking, phishing and other social engineering attacks, attachments to emails, actions of persons inside our organization or persons with access to the systems upon which we depend. The techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to information systems, and networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition to traditional computer “hackers”, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), employee theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions). We anticipate that these threats will continue to grow in scope and complexity over time. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. Our ability to monitor future CROs and other contractors and consultants' data security is further limited. While we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs, our business operations, and the privacy or confidentiality of the information that we maintain. For example, the loss of preclinical or clinical data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability, in particular if such security incident would lead to the exposure of personal data, sensitive data and confidential information to unauthorized persons. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees that are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, negative publicity, and other harm to our business and our competitive position. Any security breach affecting us, our CROs, contractors, consultants or other partners or our industry, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and lead to regulatory scrutiny. Likewise, we may rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could face governmental reporting obligations, fines, incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We may have contractual and legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities, and others of security breaches involving certain types of data. In addition, our agreements with collaborators may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause our collaborators to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, any actual or perceived security breach could result in legal claims or proceedings, regulatory investigations or actions, and other types of liability under laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, including federal, state and foreign data protection and privacy regulations, violations of which could result in significant penalties and fines in the EU and United States. In addition, although we seek to detect and investigate all data security incidents, security breaches and other incidents of unauthorized access to our information technology systems and data can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying such breaches or incidents may lead to increased harm and legal exposure of the type described above.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches or information system failures.

In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal and state health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and fines if we violate HIPAA. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, certain state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than U.S. federal law and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of the sale of personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches. Although the CCPA exempts some data regulated by HIPAA and certain data regarding clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we maintain about California residents. Other privacy legislation has been proposed at the federal and state levels, which, if enacted, could adversely affect our business. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our operations may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from foreign data protection authorities. Our clinical trial programs and research collaborations outside the United States may implicate foreign data protection laws, including in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Many countries have established, or are in the process of establishing, privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, and contractors must comply. For example, European data protection laws, including, without limitation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, and the UK Data Protection Act introduced strict requirements regarding the processing of personal data, including clinical trial data, which may apply to the company to the extent it processes the personal data of data subjects within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and/or the United Kingdom. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Laws such as these give rise to an increasingly complex set of compliance obligations on us. These data protection rules continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. We strive to comply with these rules and obligations to the extent possible. Such compliance is a rigorous and time-consuming process.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The GDPR and UK Data Protection Act set out extensive compliance requirements, including providing detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and processed, demonstrating that an appropriate legal basis is in place or otherwise exists to justify data processing activities; granting new rights for data subjects in regard to their personal data, as well as enhancing pre-existing rights (e.g., data subject access requests); introducing the obligation to notify data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches; imposing limitations on retention of personal data; maintaining a record of data processing; and complying with the principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as health information, impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. Moreover, the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act increase our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EU by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial participants and investigators. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United States. On July 16, 2020, in a case known as Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the Standard Contractual Clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place. Additionally, new Standard Contractual Clauses that repealed the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted under the Data Protection Directive have recently been adopted. We will thus need to update all of our contracts entailing the transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area with this new Standard Contractual Clauses. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including on the new Standard Contractual Clauses, </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">79</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we conduct clinical trials, it could affect our business. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, we also have to comply with the UK-specific requirements related to data protection, including with respect to transfer of personal data outside of the UK, which increases our regulatory compliance burden.

Companies that must comply with the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement actions that require us to change the way we use personal data, and/or prohibitions on the use of personal data. Such penalties may be in addition to any civil litigation claims by data subjects. We may not be successful in avoiding potential liability or disruption of business resulting from the failure to comply with these laws and, even if we comply with laws, we may be subject to liability because of a security incident. Further, complying with the applicable notification requirements in the event of a security breach could result in significant costs.

Although we do not currently conduct any clinical trials in Russia or Ukraine, further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business or conduct certain research and development operations, which could adversely affect our business, our supply chain for our product candidates, our collaborators or our ability to carry out our clinical trials.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from paying, offering, promising or authorizing others to pay or offer anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are owned and operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, business partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.

Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or products targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development activities involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.

Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act was signed into law in March 2020. The CARES Act modifies certain of the changes made by the Tax Act. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act, or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. The foregoing items, as well as any other future changes in tax laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. For example, proposals have recently been made in Congress (which have not yet been enacted) to make certain tax law changes that could have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.</span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">82</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As of December 31, 2021, we had $85.8 million of U.S. federal, $90.3 million of state and $16.4 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited. The CARES Act also provides for the ability for companies to carry back net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2021 for up to 5 years. We evaluated the provisions of the CARES Act and, as a result, we received approximately $0.2 million as of December 31, 2020, related to the carry back of our 2019 net operating loss to claim a refund for prior federal tax liabilities and, as a result, our net operating loss carryforwards will be reduced.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our NOL carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the U.S. and state tax authorities. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and R&amp;D credits to offset its post-change income may be limited. This could limit the amount of NOLs or R&amp;D credit carryforwards that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent ownership changes and changes to the U.S. tax rules in respect of the utilization of NOLs and R&amp;D credits carried forward may further affect the limitation in future years. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In February 2021, we completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our formation. The results of this study indicated that we experienced ownership changes as defined by Section 382 of the Code in 2016 and 2020. These ownership changes have subjected and will continue to subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following an ownership change. Based on the results of the study, management has determined that these limitations may have a material impact on our ability to utilize our net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future tax liabilities. </span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_85"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Risks Related to Our Common Stock</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">An active, liquid and orderly trading market may not develop for our common stock and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Prior to our IPO in April 2020, there was no public market for shares of our common stock.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We are evaluating these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. The increased costs may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our services. Moreover, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:6pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are an “emerging growth company” and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not approved previously. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date that we are no longer an “emerging growth company” or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2025, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which occurs when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30, or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company immediately.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on the exemptions and reduced disclosure obligations applicable to emerging growth companies.

We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing us to fail to make a required related party transaction disclosure. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls.

We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business, continuity plans and response strategy. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Massachusetts ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses effective March 24, 2020, through April 7, 2020, which was subsequently extended through May 18, 2020. On May 18, 2020, the governor of Massachusetts issued a new order implementing a phased re-opening of workplaces, effective May 18, 2020.  On May 29, 2021, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts permitted all industries to fully re-open and on June 15, 2021, the governor of Massachusetts signed an executive order that terminated the Commonwealth's State of Emergency. Because of the nature of our operations, we were considered to be an essential business so our operations were only partially affected by these orders. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on third-party businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the spread of COVID-19, we closed our principal executive office in March 2020, with our administrative employees continuing their work outside of our office, and limited the number of staff in any given research laboratory. In July 2021, we implemented a plan to reopen our office to allow employees to return to the office, which is based on a phased approach that is principles-based and local in design, with a focus on continuity of preclinical studies and clinical trial activities, employee safety and optimal work environment. While we are experiencing limited financial impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, particularly in light of variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Preclinical and Clinical Developments</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">With respect to preclinical and clinical development, we have taken measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote participant monitoring where possible, to maintain participant safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. For several of our clinical development programs, we are experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, a disruption or delay in our ability to initiate trial sites and enroll and assess participants. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience an impact on our ability to enroll participants in our clinical trials. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience an impact on the ability to supply study drug, report trial results or interact with clinicians, investigators, regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, we could experience significant disruptions to our preclinical and clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Supply Chain</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As for our third-party manufacturers, distributors, and other partners, we are working closely with them to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our clinical supply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to have adequate supply for the development of our product candidates. However, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist and impact essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our product candidates, which would adversely impact our ability to carry out our clinical trials.</span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">92</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Financial Impact</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to adversely affect our business operations, our clinical development and regulatory efforts, our corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, as a result of uncertainty regarding ultimate duration of the pandemic, particularly in light of variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States, Australia and New Zealand and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease.</span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_118"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Licensing Agreements </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">2016 Exclusive Patent License Agreement with The General Hospital Corporation </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In April 2016, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation, or MGH, which was subsequently amended in May 2017 and February 2018.

We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging in the low-single digits to mid-single digits. The royalty rates are subject to up to a maximum 50% reduction for lack of a valid claim, in the event that it is necessary for us to obtain a license to any third-party intellectual property related to the licensed products, and generic competition. The obligation to pay royalties under the MGH Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of expiry of the last valid claim of the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country and ten years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.

Our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our product candidates.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.

We apply the revenue recognition guidance in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, which was adopted January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method. Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to our customer. All variable consideration, including milestones and royalties, is constrained until the cumulative revenue related to the consideration is no longer probable of reversal. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods or services. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. We currently measure progress according to the expenditure of research and development efforts, based on costs incurred, as this is the best indicator of performance. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We receive payments from our customers based on billing schedules established in each contract.

We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. </span></div><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">100</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Stock-Based Compensation </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We account for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employees as stock-based compensation expense at fair value. Our stock-based payments include stock options and grants of common stock, including common stock subject to vesting. The measurement date for awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Our Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected term of the award. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and these assumptions either increase or decrease, our stock-based compensation expense could materially differ in the future. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying statements of operations based on the function to which the related services are provided. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the portion of awards that have vested. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. </span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">(1)</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:34.79pt"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_139"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</span></div><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:1pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div id="i209d9e865c8342ba8250580b228214a3_142"></div><div style="margin-bottom:4pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Emerging Growth Company Status </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted.

Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Basis for Opinion</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span

Therapeutics, Inc. (“Keros” or the “Company”) was incorporated in 2015 as a Delaware corporation. Its principal offices are in Lexington, Massachusetts. The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients suffering from hematological and musculoskeletal disorders with high unmet medical need. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company’s lead protein therapeutic product candidate, KER-050, is an engineered ligand trap comprised of a modified ligand-binding domain of the transforming growth factor-beta (“TGF-ß”) receptor known as activin receptor type IIA that is fused to the portion of the human antibody known as the Fc domain. KER-050 is being developed for the treatment of low blood cell counts (“cytopenias”), including anemia and thrombocytopenia, in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and in patients with myelofibrosis. The Company has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MDS and reported preliminary data from Part 1 of this trial most recently in December 2021.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company’s lead small molecule product candidate, KER-047, is designed to selectively and potently inhibit activin receptor-like kinase-2 (“ALK2”), a TGF-ß receptor. KER-047 is being developed for the treatment of anemia resulting from iron imbalance as a direct consequence of elevated ALK2 signaling, including the Company’s initial target, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (“IRIDA”). In December 2020, the Company reported topline data from its completed Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-047 in healthy volunteers. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company’s third product candidate, KER-012, is designed to bind to and inhibit the signaling of TGF-ß ligands that suppress bone growth, including activin A and activin B, to potentially promote bone growth. KER-012 is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) and for the treatment of disorders associated with bone loss, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. In September 2021, the Company commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of KER-012 in healthy volunteers.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Since its inception in 2015, the Company has devoted the majority of its resources to business planning, research and development of its product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies, raising capital and recruiting management and technical staff to support these operations.

At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets and current and non-current lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew.

Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment.

The terms of these arrangements typically include payment of one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront fees; reimbursement of research and development costs; development, clinical, regulatory and commercial sales milestone payments, and royalties on net sales of licensed products.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i)&nbsp;identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii)&nbsp;determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct; (iii)&nbsp;measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv)&nbsp;allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v)&nbsp;recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The promised goods or services in the Company’s arrangements typically consist of a license, or option to license, rights to the Company’s intellectual property or research and development services. The Company provides options to additional items in such arrangements, which are accounted for as separate contracts when the customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to the customer. Performance obligations are promised goods or services in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and are considered distinct when (i)&nbsp;the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources and (ii)&nbsp;the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on its own or whether the required expertise is readily available and whether the goods or services are integral or dependent to other goods or services in the contract.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of potential payment and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric></span></ix:continuation></span><div style="height:31.5pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt;text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">F-10</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:31.5pt;width:100%"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span><br></span></div></div><span><ix:continuation id="i7b1531475c3e41aaa7e5d7969b120523" continuedat="i9df7edd720b44050825a50e3064a00a4" inside-table="false" continued-taxonomy="true" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isadditionalitemsonly="false"><span><ix:continuation id="ib3107037dcf5497882e45e215894fe3d" inside-table="false" continued-taxonomy="true" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isadditionalitemsonly="false"><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company’s contracts often include development and regulatory milestone payments that are assessed under the most likely amount method and constrained if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would occur. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development and clinical milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration and other research and development revenue in the period of adjustment.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i)&nbsp;when the related sales occur, or (ii)&nbsp;when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for the satisfaction of each performance obligation.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods or services. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules established in each contract.

The Company lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on common stock and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric></span><div style="margin-bottom:2pt;margin-top:4pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Income Taxes</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"><span><ix:continuation id="i92b2b9eb9c1f4416b3c530855d1d64c4" inside-table="false" continued-taxonomy="true" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isadditionalitemsonly="false">The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and tax returns.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that these assets may not be realized. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If it is not more likely than not that a position will be sustained, none of the benefit attributable to the position is recognized. The tax benefit to be recognized for any tax position that meets the&nbsp;more-likely-than-not&nbsp;recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency.

Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ("ASU No. 2019-12"). ASU No. 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU No. 2019-12 also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes, enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill.

Under Section 382 of the Code (“Section 382”), certain substantial changes in the Company’s ownership, including the sale of the Company or significant changes in ownership due to sales of equity, may have limited, or may limit in the future, the amount of net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits which could be used annually to offset future taxable income. The Company completed an analysis under Section 382 through November 17, 2020 and determined that on April 15, 2016 and April 13, 2020, ownership changes had occurred.

The Company may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in the Company’s stock ownership, some of which may be outside the Company’s control. As a result, its ability to use its pre-change NOLs or tax credits to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9.5pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9.5pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of research and development credits and net operating losses.
