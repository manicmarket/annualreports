place. We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us to be an attractive
purchaser of their businesses. We make these businesses our majority-owned subsidiaries and actively manage and grow such businesses.
We expect to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements.</p><div>

we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for
small businesses is highly fragmented and provides significant opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. For example,
according to GF Data, platform acquisitions with enterprise values greater than $50.0 million commanded valuation premiums 30% higher
than platform acquisitions with enterprise values less than $50.0 million (8.2x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) versus 6.3x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA, respectively).</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We also believe that significant opportunities
exist to improve the performance of the businesses upon their acquisition. In the past, our manager has acquired businesses that are
often formerly owned by seasoned entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our manager has frequently found that there
have been opportunities to further build upon the management teams of acquired businesses. In addition, our manager has frequently found
that financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, both of which can lead to substantial
improvements in earnings and cash flow. Finally, because these businesses tend to be too small to have their own corporate development
efforts, we believe opportunities exist to assist these businesses in meaningful ways as they pursue organic or external growth strategies
that were often not pursued by their previous owners.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our long-term goals are to grow regular distributions

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Unlike buyers of small businesses that rely on significant leverage to consummate
acquisitions (as demonstrated by the data presented by total enterprise value, or TEV, below), we plan to limit the use of third-party
(i.e., external) acquisition leverage so that our debt will not exceed the market value of the assets we acquire and so that our debt
to EBITDA ratio will not exceed 1.25x to 1 for our operating subsidiaries. We believe that limiting leverage in this manner will avoid
the imposition on stringent lender controls on our operations that would otherwise potentially hamper the growth of our operating subsidiaries
and otherwise harm our business even during times when we have positive operating cash flows. Additionally, in our experience, leverage
rarely leads to “break-out” returns and often creates negative return outcomes that are not correlated with the profitability
of the business.</p><div>

presents an attractive opportunity from the perspective of both (i) return on assets or equity and (ii) an easily identifiable path for
growing the acquired businesses. We believe that attractive opportunities will increasingly present themselves as private sector owners
seek to monetize their interests in longstanding and privately held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core”
operations.</p><div>

targeting capital light businesses operating in niche geographical markets with a clearly identifiable competitive advantage within the

light manufacturing, distribution, alternative/specialty finance and in select cases, specialty retail. While we believe that the professional
experience of our management team within the industries identified above will offer the greatest number of acquisition opportunities,
we will not eschew opportunities if a business enjoys an inarguable moat around its products and services in an industry which our management
team may have less familiarity.</p><div>

and complex. Our manager has historically taken from 2 to 24 months to perform due diligence on, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although

to complete a sale of a business within any specific time frame. &nbsp;We may also decide to own and operate some or all of our businesses
in perpetuity if our board believes that it makes sense to do so. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the resulting proceeds to retire
debt or retain proceeds for future acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Generally, we do not expect to make special distributions
at the time of a sale of one of our businesses; instead, we expect that we will seek to gradually increase regular common shareholder
distributions over time.</p><div>

the expected cash flows from the target business as accurately as possible. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels
of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that our detailed
due diligence review process allows us to more accurately estimate future cash flows and more effectively evaluate the prospects for
operating the business in the future. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and
operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax,
regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We may also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.</p><div>

experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment,
supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute the business plan for the target business.
Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we actively
seek to enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for
the target business.</p><div>

investment bankers and business brokers targeting small businesses. By employing an institutionalized, multi-platform marketing strategy,
we believe our manager has established a robust national network of personal relationships with intermediaries, seasoned operating executives,
entrepreneurs and managers, thereby firmly establishing our presence and credibility in the small business market. In contrast to many
other buyers of and investors in small businesses, we believe that we can buy businesses at value-oriented multiples and through our asset
management activities with a group of professional, experienced and talented operating partners, create appreciable value. We believe

We employ an institutionalized, multi-platform approach to sourcing new acquisition opportunities. Our deal sourcing efforts include
leveraging relationships with more than 3,000 qualified deal sources through regular calling, mail and e-mail campaigns, assignment of
regional marketing responsibilities, in-person visits and high-profile sponsorship of important conferences and industry events. We supplement
these activities by retaining selected intermediary firms to conduct targeted searches for opportunities in specific categories on an
opportunistic basis. As a result of the significant time and effort spent on these activities, we believe we established close relationships
and unique “top of mind” awareness with many of the most productive intermediary sources for small business acquisition opportunities
in the United States. While reinforcing our market leadership, this capability enables us to generate a large number of attractive acquisition
opportunities.</p><div>

Capabilities in the Small Business Market</i></b>. We deploy a differentiated approach to acquiring businesses in the small business
market. Our management concentrates their efforts on mature companies with sustainable value propositions, which can be supported by
our resources and institutional expertise. Our evaluation of acquisition opportunities typically involves significant input from a seasoned
operating partner with relevant experience, which we believe enhances both our diligence and ongoing monitoring capabilities. In addition,
we approach every acquisition opportunity with creative structures, which we believe enables us to engineer mutually attractive scenarios
for sellers, whereas competing buyers may be limited by their rigid structural requirements. We believe our commitment to conservative
capital structures and valuation will enhance each acquired operating subsidiary’s ability to deliver consistent levels of cash
available for distribution, while additionally supporting reinvestment for growth.</p><div>

needs and certain qualitative objectives of the target’s owners and management team. In addition to serving as an exit pathway
for sellers, we seek to align our interests with the sellers by enabling them to retain and/or earn (through incentive compensation)
a substantial economic interest in their businesses following the acquisition and by typically allowing the incumbent management team
to retain operating control of the acquired operating subsidiary on a day-to-day basis. We believe that our company is an appealing buyer
for small business owners and managers due to our track record of capitalizing portfolio companies conservatively, enhancing our ability
to execute on its strategic initiatives and adding equity value. As a result, we believe business owners and managers will find our company
to be a dynamic, value-added buyer that brings considerable resources to achieve their strategic, capital and operating needs, resulting
in substantial value creation for the operating subsidiary.</p><div>

partners - former entrepreneurs and executives with extensive experience building, managing and optimizing successful small businesses
across a range of industries. We believe that our operating partner model will enable us to make a significant improvement in the operating
subsidiary, as compared to other buyers, such as traditional private equity firms, which rely principally upon investment professionals
to make acquisition/investment and monitoring decisions regarding not only the business, financial and legal due diligence aspects of
a business but also the more operational aspects including industry dynamics, management strength and strategic growth initiatives. We
typically engage an operating partner soon after identifying a target business for acquisition, enhancing our acquisition judgment and
building the acquisition team’s relationship with the subsidiary’s management team. Operating partners usually serve as a
member of the board of directors of an operating subsidiary and spend two to four days per month working with the subsidiary’s management
team. We leverage the operating partner’s extensive experience to build the management team, improve operations and assist with
strategic growth initiatives, resulting in value creation.</p><div>

in the acquisition, strategic and operational decisions critical to the long-term success of small businesses. Since 2000, the management

30 small businesses on all facets of their strategy, development and operations, which we have successfully translated into unique, institutionalized

loss, deduction and credit. As a holder of our shares, you may not receive cash distributions sufficient in amount to cover taxes in respect
of your allocable share of our net taxable income. We will file a partnership return with the IRS and will issue you with tax information,

variety of services for us, which entitles it to receive a management fee. As holder of our allocation shares, our manager has the right
to a preferred distribution in the form of a profit allocation upon the occurrence of certain events. Our manager paid $1,000 for the
allocation shares. In addition, our manager will have the right to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager
upon termination of the management services agreement.</p><div>

including delivery, installation, warranty service and appliance repair and maintenance. We are the largest independent appliance service
company in Sonoma County. Our service technicians are experts, averaging 15 years of field experience with factory training. They are
vendor certified to handle our customers’ kitchen appliance, laundry, and outdoor appliance service needs. We also offer extended
warranties.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We provide premium and super premium products
to the North Bay customer. A significant number of the appliances in our 5,700 SKU catalog are subject to a unilateral minimum retail
price policy, or UMRP,&nbsp;or minimum advertised pricing restrictions. UMRP restricts a reseller from discounting the customer price
for an appliance below a vendor published UMRP and product promotions are solely those specified by the vendor and unilaterally available.
We thrive in the premium market by proving the customer with a higher overall perceived value as well as a competitive total invoice
cost by offering premium service at reasonable rates. Our sales associates are industry professionals with an average more than 15 years
of experience selling appliances. This team of six averages over eleven years seniority with the senior member having been with us for
26 years. The premium appliance market requires this expertise as very often sales and customer service teams are interacting with designers,
builders, and contractors, as well as our core customer, the homeowner. Our hard earned reputation for this expertise in sales, installation
and service accretes to its advantage when it competes directly across product lines that are also available from other local resellers
and big box competitors. Our merchant and sales team are responsible to ensure that pricing and promotion for these appliances are competitive.</p><div>

Our role in providing premium appliances can often require substantial pre-sales support, such as when quoting a multi-appliance bid
package for a builder. Since 2020, there has been a material shift toward online sales and the appliance industry is no exception. In
2019, the most popular search terms for the appliance industry ended with the modifier “near me” and in 2020 that modifier
was replaced with “delivered.” Confirming availability, managing backordered product and coordinating delivery and installation
are all critical service functions for us in the extended COVID-19 environment.</p><div>

governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among other areas, apply to
the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. For example, certain applicable privacy laws and regulations require
us to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies.
Related laws may govern the manner in which we transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach
or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state
or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to
assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose
laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally
could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures
to comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that
impose additional compliance burdens on companies doing business on the Internet.</p><div>

we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of these products and raw materials from our existing suppliers or alternates in a timely
fashion or at a reasonable cost. If we fail to secure a sufficient supply of key products and raw materials in a timely fashion, it would
result in a significant delay in delivering our products and services, which may cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers.
Furthermore, failure to obtain sufficient supply of these products and raw materials at a reasonable cost could also harm our revenue

that provide specialist finish carpentry services, such as on-site construction and the installation of doors, windows, stairs, shelving,
cupboards, cabinets and decks. Carpenters experience steep competition from do-it-yourself (DIY) homeowners in the housing alterations
and additions market and from other skilled tradespeople in the new building construction market, such as general building contractors’
in-house staff.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We compete with numerous competitors in our primary
markets, with reputation, price, workmanship and services being the principal competitive factors. We primarily compete with other specialty
builders in our markets, such as Franklin’s, Western Idaho, and to a lesser extent against national retail chains such as Home Depot
and Lowes. Barriers to entry exist from other similar companies coming into the regions given the pool of available labor working in finished
carpentry in the regions, and the close working relationships that exist between industry players in the regions. These barriers to entry
are also experienced by larger competitors from outside the regions, providing them with substantial challenges in establishing a foothold.
As a result of the implementation of our business strategy, which is delivering high value, quality products and customized solutions
and installations, we anticipate that we will continue to effectively compete against the aforementioned competition.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our top-selling product is the Bad Boy horn, which
has a one-piece design that requires no hoses. It installs in minutes by simply transferring the vehicle’s factory horn wires to
the compressor, and mounts with one bolt included in kit. The Bad Boy produces a powerful dual tone air horn sound that is two times louder
than the factory horn. It is compact in size to fit any car, truck, motorcycle and any 12-volt vehicle that wants a loud air horn sound.
A heavy-duty maintenance free compressor provides years of dependable service.</p><div>

solicitation and development of new accounts, as well as working with existing customers to develop promotions and incentives for our
products. We have had relationships with these regional sales companies for 13 to 15 years on-average. All major customers are serviced

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our innovative retail product packaging design
is also a highly effective marketing tool in direct-to-consumer selling. Featuring quick response (QR) barcode technology, customers are
able to scan product packaging using their smart phone or mobile device to instantly see product information, watch demonstration videos,
or even hear horn demos. There is no need for special in-store displays or additional shelf space as all information is accessible directly
by scanning the product packaging. It is like having a virtual sales associate in-store. Packaging also features scan-back’s, an
instant rebate that is applied at the register upon checkout.</p><div>

promotional programs for customers, e-commerce via our website, as well as email blasts and customer print catalogs. We mail print and/or
electronic CD catalogs to established accounts every 18 months with new product information inserted via supplemental sell-sheets. The
full product catalog was last updated in 2019 and a new 2021-2022 catalog will be finished and ready to be mailed in the first or second
quarter of 2022. There will also be a digital version of the catalog available for download. New product launches and updates are also
sent to customers via email blast periodically.</p><div>

essential business and remained open during the pandemic, with certain occupancy restrictions at times, so it did not experience any
meaningful business interruption. However, certain key customers of Kyle’s elected to either temporarily stop building homes
or delayed their building process, particularly during the second quarter of 2020, which adversely affected Kyle’s sales.
Further, early on during the pandemic, several of Kyle’s employees had taken time off because of medical issues, and some of them did not return to employment. Kyle’s has been hiring and training new employees to replace lost productivity
because of the aforementioned loss of employees. Kyle’s did not experience any meaningful business interruption related to any
of its key suppliers; although recently, potentially as a result of the pandemic and resulting impact, Kyle’s has seen price
increases in certain key raw materials such as wood products and hardware. These increases may negatively affect Kyle’s
profitability and financial condition. If the pace of the pandemic does not continue to slow, it may continue to negatively affect
Kyle’s ability to generate sales opportunities and to hire productive employees, as well as impact the cost of raw materials.
Therefore, Kyle’s business operations may experience further delays and experience lost sales opportunities and increased
costs, which could further adversely impact Kyle’s profitability and financial condition.</p><div>

The pandemic has had a dramatic impact on Wolo’s supply chain as it has on others in the automotive aftermarket. Approximately 90%
of Wolo’s vendor base is located in China. The pandemic issues impacting ports in the U.S. due to lack of personnel has had a ripple
effect on Chinese suppliers. Containers are slow to be emptied in the U.S., causing a backlog of ships waiting to get into ports and limiting
containers and ships returning to China. The lack of containers and available space on ships has escalated shipping costs by over 300%
from 2020. Costs for raw materials have also started to increase due to availability. Wolo cannot absorb these increases and began passing
on a price increase to customers starting June 1, 2021, although the effective date may be later for some customers. We believe that this
is an industry-wide issue and that it should not put Wolo in an unfavorable pricing position.</p><div>

a critical audit matter description relating to our ability to continue as a going concern due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding
our future cash flows, available capital and the risk of bias in management’s judgments and assumptions in their determination.
We have generated losses since inception and have relied on cash on hand, sales of securities, external bank lines of credit, and issuance
of third-party and related party debt to support cashflow from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred operating
losses from continuing operations of $3,721,157 (before deducting losses attributable to non-controlling interests and excluding the income

will be sufficient to fund our operations for significantly more than the next year. <span>However, we
do believe additional funds are required to execute our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses. The funds required
to execute our business plan will depend on the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business
deems acceptable in a given transaction. The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase
price of a target business the seller of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of
our subsidiaries. Given these factors, we believe that the amount of outside additional capital necessary to execute our business plan
on the low end (assuming target company sellers accept a significant portion of the purchase price in the form of seller notes or our
equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries) ranges between $100,000 to $250,000. If, and to the extent, that sellers are unwilling to
accept a significant portion of the purchase price in seller notes and equity, then the cash required to execute our business plan could

We are also required to manage relationships with a growing number of suppliers, customers and other third parties. Our information technology

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For example, if one of our data centers fails
or suffers an interruption or degradation of services, we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment deadlines, which could harm
our business. Our systems and operations, including our ability to fulfill customer orders through our logistics network, are also vulnerable
to damage or interruption from inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, labor disputes,
cyber-attacks, data loss, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. In the event of a data center failure, the move to a
back-up could take substantial time, during which time our sites could be completely shut down. Further, our back-up services may not
effectively process spikes in demand, may process transactions more slowly and may not support all of our site’s functionality.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We use complex proprietary software in our technology
infrastructure, which we seek to continually update and improve. We may not always be successful in executing these upgrades and improvements,
and the operation of our systems may be subject to failure. In particular, we have in the past and may in the future experience slowdowns
or interruptions on some or all of our sites when we are updating them, and new technologies or infrastructures may not be fully integrated
with existing systems on a timely basis, or at all. Additionally, if we expand our use of third-party services, including cloud-based
services, our technology infrastructure may be subject to increased risk of slowdown or interruption as a result of integration with such
services and/or failures by such third parties, which are out of our control. Our net revenue depends on the number of visitors who shop
on our sites and the volume of orders we can handle. Unavailability of our sites or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce
the volume of goods sold and could also materially adversely affect consumer perception of our brand.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We may experience periodic system interruptions
from time to time. In addition, continued growth in our transaction volume, as well as surges in online traffic and orders associated
with promotional activities or seasonal trends in our business, place additional demands on our technology platform and could cause or
exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions. If there is a substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our sites or the number of orders
placed by customers, we may be required to further expand and upgrade our technology, logistics network, transaction processing systems
and network infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any,
in the use of our sites or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases on a timely basis. In order
to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our sites, which is particularly
challenging given the rapid rate at which new technologies, customer preferences and expectations and industry standards and practices
are evolving in the e-commerce industry. Accordingly, we redesign and enhance various functions on our sites on a regular basis, and we
may experience instability and performance issues as a result of these changes.</p><div>

Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from suppliers with international manufacturing operations, including the imposition
of additional import restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost or reduce
the supply of merchandise available to our customers and materially adversely affect our financial performance as well as our reputation

foreign currency against the U.S. dollar may result in higher costs to us for those goods. Declines in foreign currencies and currency
exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign suppliers. This, in turn,
might cause such foreign suppliers to demand higher prices for merchandise in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with
any currency devaluation, delay merchandise shipments, or discontinue selling to us altogether, any of which could ultimately reduce our

labor activism, health epidemics or bioterrorism. We are also subject to risks of breakage or other damage during delivery by any of these

and as new devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing applications for
these alternative devices and platforms. Additionally, we may need to devote significant resources to the support and maintenance of such

include levels of unemployment; consumer debt levels; changes in net worth based on market changes and uncertainty; home foreclosures
and changes in home values or the overall housing, residential construction or home improvement markets; fluctuating interest rates; credit
availability, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; government actions; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs;
fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Adverse economic changes in any
of the regions in which we sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and could negatively affect net revenue and have a material

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our business is highly dependent upon email and
other messaging services for promoting our sites and products. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails or other messages to our
subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open our emails or other messages, our net revenue and profitability would be materially adversely
affected. Changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may also reduce the number of subscribers opening our emails.
For example, in 2013 Google&nbsp;Inc.’s Gmail service began offering a feature that organizes incoming emails into categories (for
example, primary, social and promotions). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features may result in our emails being
delivered in a less prominent location in a subscriber’s inbox or viewed as “spam” by our subscribers and may reduce
the likelihood of that subscriber opening our emails. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery
of emails or other messages could also adversely impact our business. From time to time, Internet service providers or other third parties
may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver
emails or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit our ability to send such communications or impose
additional requirements upon us in connection with sending such communications would also materially adversely impact our business. Our
use of email and other messaging services to send communications about our products or other matters may also result in legal claims against
us, which may cause us increased expenses, and if successful might result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations
or might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or other messages. We also rely on social networking messaging services to send
communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional
communications, any restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers’ ability to send communications through their services,
disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking
services by customers and potential customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.</p><div>

dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trade secret
protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. We might not be able to obtain
broad protection for all of our intellectual property. The protection of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure
of significant financial, managerial and operational resources. We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement,
misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Any
litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical

steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating
our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to broadly enforce all of our intellectual property rights. Any of our intellectual property
rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Additionally, the process of obtaining
intellectual property protections is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to pursue all necessary or desirable actions
at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these protections will adequately safeguard
our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other
intellectual property rights are uncertain. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire
equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights. We may also be exposed to claims from third parties claiming infringement
of their intellectual property rights, or demanding the release or license of open source software or derivative works that we developed
using such software (which could include our proprietary code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source
license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions
of our source code, be limited in or cease using the implicated software unless and until we can re-engineer such software to avoid infringement
or change the use of the implicated open source software.</p><div>

States International Trade Commission. We have received in the past, and we anticipate we may in the future receive, communications alleging
that certain products we sell infringe the patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights of OEMs

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our manager owns all of our allocation shares,
which generally will entitle our manager to receive a profit allocation as a form of preferred distribution. In general, this profit allocation
is designed to pay our manager 20% of the excess of the gains upon dispositions of our subsidiaries, plus an amount equal to the net income
of such subsidiaries since their acquisition by us, over an annualized hurdle rate. If our manager resigns or is removed, for any reason,
it will remain the owner of our allocation shares. It will therefore remain entitled to all profit allocations while it holds our allocation
shares regardless of whether it is terminated as our manager. If we terminate our manager, it may therefore be difficult or impossible
for us to find a replacement to serve the function of our manager, because we would not be able to force our manager to transfer its allocation
shares to a replacement manager so that the replacement manager could be entitled to a profit allocation. Therefore, as a practical matter,
it may be difficult for us to replace our manager without its cooperation. If it becomes necessary to replace our manager and we are unable
to replace our manager without its cooperation, we may be unable to continue to manage our operations effectively and our business may
fail.</p><div>

with our manager, any fees, costs and expenses already earned or otherwise payable to our manager upon termination would become immediately
due. Moreover, if our manager were to be removed and our management services agreement terminated by a vote of our board of directors
and a majority of our common shares other than common shares beneficially owned by our manager, we would also owe a termination fee to
our manager on top of the other fees, costs and expenses. In addition, the management services agreement is silent as to whether termination
of our manager “for cause” would result in a termination fee; there is therefore a risk that the agreement may be interpreted
to entitle our manager to a termination fee even if terminated “for cause”. The termination fee would equal twice the sum
of the amount of the quarterly management fees calculated with respect to the four fiscal quarters immediately preceding the termination
date of the management services agreement. As a result, we could incur significant management fees as a result of the termination of our
manager, which may increase the risk that our business may be unable to meet its financial obligations or otherwise fail.</p><div>

distributions from us. There is, accordingly, a risk that our shareholders may not receive cash distributions equal to their allocated
portion of our taxable income or even in an amount sufficient to satisfy the tax liability that results from that income. This risk is
attributable to a number of variables, such as results of operations, unknown liabilities, government regulations, financial covenants
relating to our debt, the need for funds for future acquisitions and/or to satisfy short- and long-term working capital needs of our businesses,
and the discretion and authority of our board of directors to make distributions or modify our distribution policy.</p><div>

file an annual partnership information return with the IRS. The information return will report the results of our activities and will
contain a Schedule K-1 for each company shareholder reflecting allocations of profits or losses (and items thereof) to our members, that
is, to the shareholders. Each partner of a partnership is required to report on his or her income tax return his or her share of items
of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and other items of the partnership (in each case, as reflected on such Schedule K-1) without
regard to whether cash distributions are received. Each holder will be required to report on his or her tax return his or her allocable
share of company income, gain, loss, deduction, credit and other items for our taxable year that ends with or within the holder’s
taxable year. Thus, holders of common shares will be required to report taxable income (and thus be subject to significant income tax
liability) without a corresponding current receipt of cash if we were to recognize taxable income and not make cash distributions to the
shareholders.</p><div>

of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership is governed by the operating agreement, but is also subject to
income tax laws governing the allocation of the partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions or credits. These laws are complex,
and there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully challenge any allocation set forth in any Schedule K-1 issued by us.
Whether an allocation set forth in any particular K-1 issued to a shareholder will be accepted by the IRS also depends on a facts and
circumstances analysis of the underlying economic arrangement of our shareholders. If the IRS were to prevail in challenging the allocations
provided by the operating agreement, the amount of income or loss allocated to holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes could be increased
or reduced or the character of allocated income or loss could be modified. See “<i>Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations</i>”

person), certain real property rents, certain gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gains from the sale of stock or

income exception may not so qualify if it is considered to be derived from an active conduct of a business. For example, the IRS may assert
that interest received by us from our subsidiaries is not qualifying income because it is derived in the conduct of a lending business.
If we fail to satisfy the qualifying income exception or is required to register under the Investment Company Act, we will be classified
as a corporation for U.S. federal (and certain state and local) income tax purposes, and shareholders would be treated as shareholders
in a domestic corporation. We would be required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates on its income. In addition, we would
likely be liable for state and local income and/or franchise taxes on our income. Distributions to the shareholders would constitute ordinary
dividend income (taxable at then existing ordinary income rates) or, in certain cases, qualified dividend income (which is generally subject
to tax at reduced tax rates) to such holders to the extent of our earnings and profits, and the payment of these dividends would not be
deductible to us. Shareholders would receive an IRS Form 1099-DIV in respect of such dividend income and would not receive a Schedule
K-1. Taxation of our company as a corporation could result in a material reduction in distributions to our shareholders and after-tax
return and would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of, or materially adversely affect the market price of, our shares.</p><div>

Act. In order to effect such treatment, we may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations, forego attractive business

the broker and/or dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. The transaction costs associated with penny stocks are high, reducing
the number of broker-dealers who may be willing to engage in the trading of our shares. These additional penny stock disclosure requirements
are burdensome and may reduce all the trading activity in the market for our common shares. As long as our common shares are subject to
the penny stock rules, holders of our common shares may find it more difficult to sell their common shares.</p><div>

a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances
of that case in accordance with the applicable state and federal law. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a contractual pre-dispute
jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the United States
Supreme Court. However, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable, including under
the laws of the State of Delaware, which govern our operating agreement, by a federal or state court in the State of Delaware, which has
non-exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the operating agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual pre-dispute
jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived the right
to a jury trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to our operating agreement. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel
regarding the jury waiver provision before entering into the operating agreement.</span></p><div>

including claims under federal securities laws, you or such other holder or beneficial owner may not be entitled to a jury trial with
respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us. If a lawsuit is brought against us
under our operating agreement, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court, which would be conducted according
to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have, including results that could be less
favorable to the plaintiffs in any such action.</span></p><div>

needed for acquisitions and to satisfy short- and long-term working capital needs of our businesses, or if our operating subsidiaries
do not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to support the payment of such distributions. In particular, we may incur debt in the

the pandemic, several of Kyle’s employees had taken time off because of medical issues, and some of them did not return to employment.
Kyle’s has been hiring and training new employees to replace lost productivity because of the aforementioned loss of employees.
Kyle’s did not experience any meaningful business interruption related to any of its key suppliers; although recently, potentially
as a result of the pandemic and resulting impact, Kyle’s has seen price increases in certain key raw materials such as wood products
and hardware. These increases may negatively affect Kyle’s profitability and financial condition. If the pace of the pandemic does
not continue to slow, it may continue to negatively affect Kyle’s ability to generate sales opportunities and to hire productive
employees, as well as impact the cost of raw materials. Therefore, Kyle’s business operations may experience further delays and
experience lost sales opportunities and increased costs, which could further adversely impact Kyle’s profitability and financial

business and thus remained open during the pandemic, while complying with federal and Nevada state guidelines regarding occupancy restrictions.
However, since a substantive amount of its materials come from Asia, where its manufacturing network is located, Innovative Cabinets did
experience longer supply chain lead-times and higher logistics costs. It has been exploring alternative sourcing opportunities. Given
the prevailing market conditions for building supplies and materials, it may continue to experience supply chain issues and higher supply
costs, which could adversely impact its profitability and financial condition.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Wolo qualified as an essential business and remained
open during the pandemic. At no time during the pandemic did it experience an internal contamination forcing it to stop its business.
The pandemic has had a dramatic impact on Wolo’s supply chain as it has on others in the automotive aftermarket. Approximately 90%
of Wolo’s vendor base is located in China. The pandemic issues impacting ports in the U.S. due to lack of personnel has had a ripple
effect on Chinese suppliers. Containers are slow to be emptied in the U.S., causing a backlog of ships waiting to get into ports and limiting
containers and ships returning to China. The lack of containers and available space on ships has escalated shipping costs by over 300%
from 2020. Costs for raw materials have also started to increase due to availability. Wolo cannot absorb these increases and began passing
on a price increase to customers starting June 1, 2021, although the effective date may be later for some customers. We believe that this
is an industry-wide issue and that it should not put Wolo in an unfavorable pricing position.</p><div>

additional cash to continue our operations over the next twelve months, we do believe additional funds are required to execute our business
plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses. The funds required to execute our business plan will depend on the size, capital
structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction. The amount of
funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller of that
business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries. Given these factors, we believe
that the amount of outside additional capital necessary to execute our business plan on the low end (assuming target company sellers
accept a significant portion of the purchase price in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries) ranges
between $100,000 to $250,000. If, and to the extent, that sellers are unwilling to accept a significant portion of the purchase price
in seller notes and equity, then the cash required to execute our business plan could be as much as $5,000,000. We will seek growth as
funds become available from cash flow, borrowings, additional capital raised privately or publicly, or seller retained financing.</p><div>

shares, is entitled to receive a twenty percent (20%) profit allocation as a form of preferred equity distribution, subject to an annual
hurdle rate of eight percent (8%), as follows. Upon the sale of a subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum
of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high-water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary’s net income since
its acquisition by us exceeds the 8% hurdle rate. The 8% hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2% rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii) the
number of quarters such subsidiary was held by us, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary’s average share (determined based on gross
assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to GAAP with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after
a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined
based solely on the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition). The amount of profit allocation may represent a significant
cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of profit allocation paid,
when paid, will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions. See
Item 1 “<i>Business—Our Manager—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Manager’s Profit Allocation</i>” for
more information on the calculation of the profit allocation.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our operating agreement also contains a supplemental
put provision, which gives our manager the right, subject to certain conditions, to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned
by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. The amount of put price under the supplemental put provision is
determined by assuming all of our subsidiaries are sold at that time for their fair market value and then calculating the amount of profit
allocation would be payable in such a case. If the management services agreement is terminated for any reason other than our manager’s
resignation, the payment to our manager could be as much as twice the amount of such hypothetical profit allocation. As is the case with
profit allocation, the calculation of the put price is complex and based on many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty at
this time. See Item 1 “<i>Business—Our Manager—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Supplemental Put Provision</i>”
for more information on the calculation of the put price. The put price obligation, if our manager exercises its put right, will represent
a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of put price
will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions.</p><div>

following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our consolidated company. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including
the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that
are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial
condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the
need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting
estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future
events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting
policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:</span></p><div>

which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, <i>Revenue Recognition</i>.&nbsp;This ASU is based on the principle
that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.&nbsp;This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer purchase orders, including significant judgments.&nbsp;Our
adoption of this ASU resulted in no change to our results of operations or balance sheet.</span></p><div>

Obligations – The revenue that we recognize arises from orders we receive from customers. Our performance obligations under the
customer orders correspond to each sale of merchandise that we make to customers under the purchase orders; as a result, each purchase
order generally contains only one performance obligation based on the merchandise sale to be completed. Control of the delivery transfers
to customers when the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, our products, which generally occurs
when the customer assumes the risk of loss. The transfer of control generally occurs at the point of pickup, shipment, or installation.
Once this occurs, we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.</span></p><div>

Price ‒ We agree with customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the agreed
upon sales price. In our contracts with customers, we allocate the entire transaction price to the sales price, which is the basis for
the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. Any sales tax that we collect concurrently
with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.</span></p><div>

of revenue includes the cost of purchased merchandise plus freight and any applicable delivery charges from the vendor to us. Substantially
all sales are to individual retail consumers (homeowners), builders and designers. The large majority of customers are homeowners and
their contractors, with the homeowner being key in the final decisions. We have a diverse customer base with no one client accounting
for more than 5% of total revenue.</span></p><div>

construction segment revenues are derived primarily through contracts with customers whereby we specialize in all aspects of products
and services relating to finished carpentry, custom cabinetry, and countertops. We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods
or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. We account for a contract when we have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified,
payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable.</span></p><div>

contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance
obligation is satisfied. Since most contracts are bundled to include both material and installation services, we combine these items
into one performance obligation as the overall promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from
other promises in the contract and, therefore, is not distinct. We do offer assurance-type warranties on certain of its installed products
and services that do not represent a separate performance obligation and, as such, do not impact the timing or extent of revenue recognition.</span></p><div>

any contracts that are not complete at the reporting date, we recognize revenue over time, because of the continuous transfer of control
to the customer as work is performed at the customer’s site and, therefore, the customer controls the asset as it is being installed.
We utilize the cost-to-cost measure of progress method as we believe this best depicts the transfer of control of assets to the customer,
which occurs as costs are incurred. When this method is used, we estimate the costs to complete individual contracts and record as revenue
that portion of the total contract price that is considered complete based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to total anticipated
costs. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs associated with a particular contract. Total estimated
costs at completion can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, cost of labor, and materials. Additionally, external factors
such as weather, and customer delays may affect the progress of a project’s completion, and thus the timing and amount of revenue
recognition, cash flow, and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected.</span></p><div>

insignificant portion of sales, primarily retail sales, is accounted for on a point-in-time basis when the sale occurs. Sales taxes,
when incurred, are recorded as a liability and excluded from revenue on a net basis.</span></p><div>

can be subject to modification to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. We consider contract modifications
to exist when the modification either creates new, or changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Most contract modifications
are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the
context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on
the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment
to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">All
contracts are billed either contractually or as work is performed. Billing on long-term contracts occurs primarily on a monthly basis
throughout the contract period whereby we submit progress invoices for customer payment based on actual or estimated costs incurred during
the billing period. On some contracts, the customer may withhold payment on an invoice equal to a percentage of the invoice amount, which
will be subsequently paid after satisfactory completion of each project. This amount is referred to as retainage and is common practice

Obligations – The revenue that we recognize arises from orders we receive from contracts with customers. Our performance obligations

performance obligation based on the merchandise sale to be completed. Control of the delivery transfers to customers when the customer
can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the benefits from, our products, which generally occurs when the customer assumes
the risk of loss. The transfer of control generally occurs at the point of shipment of the order. Once this occurs, we have satisfied
our performance obligation and we recognize revenue.</span></p><div>

consist of trade accounts receivable from customer, credit card transactions in the process of settlement, and vendor rebates receivable.
Vendor rebates receivable represent amounts due from manufactures from whom we purchase products. Rebates receivables are stated at the
amount that management expects to collect from manufacturers, net of accounts payable amounts due the vendor. Rebates are calculated
on product and model sales programs from specific vendors. The rebates are paid at intermittent periods either in cash or through issuance
of vendor credit memos, which can be applied against vendor accounts payable. Based on our assessment of the credit history with manufacturers,
we have concluded that there should be no allowance for uncollectible accounts. We historically collect substantially all of our outstanding
rebates receivable. Retainage receivables represent the amount retained by customers to ensure the quality of the installation and is
received after satisfactory completion of each installation project. Management regularly reviews aging of retainage receivables and
changes in payment trends and records an allowance when collection of amounts due are considered at risk. The allowance for doubtful
accounts amounted to $359,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Uncollectible balances are expensed
in the periods they are determined to be uncollectible.</span></p><div>

Asien’s, inventory mainly consists of appliances that are acquired for resale and is valued at the average cost determined on a

put into production within hours of being received. The inventory in production is accounted for in the contract assets and liabilities
and follows the percentage completion methodology. Inventories consisting of materials and supplies are stated at lower of costs or market.
High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets’ inventory mainly consists of doors, door frames, baseboards, crown molding, cabinetry, countertops,
custom cabinets, closet shelving, and other related products. We value inventory at each balance sheet date to ensure that it is carried
at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined based on the average cost basis. Wolo’s inventory consists of
finished goods acquired for resale and is valued at the weighted-average cost determined on a specific item basis. We periodically evaluate
the value of items in inventory and provide write-downs to inventory based on our estimate of market conditions. We estimated an obsolescence

842 requires recognition of leases on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets
represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
arising from the leases. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value and future
minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we used our estimated
incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
A number of the lease agreements contain options to renew and options to terminate the leases early. The lease term used to calculate
ROU assets and lease liabilities only includes renewal and termination options that are deemed reasonably certain to be exercised.</span></p><div>

leases longer than twelve months. The ROU assets were adjusted per ASC 842 transition guidance for existing lease-related balances of
accrued and prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives provided by lessors. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease
cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments
for common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in
facts and circumstances on which the variable lease payments are based occur. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components

to forming The 1847 Companies LLC, Mr. Roberts was the co-founder and was co-managing principal from October 2009 to June 2011 of RW Capital
Partners LLC, the recipient of a “Green Light” letter from the U.S. Small Business Administration permitting RW Capital Partners
LLC to raise capital in pursuit of the Small Business Investment Company license with the preliminary support of the Small Business Administration.
Mr. Roberts was a founding member of Parallel Investment Partners, LP (formerly SKM Growth Investors, LP), a Dallas-based private equity
fund focused on re-capitalizations, buyouts and growth capital investments in lower middle market companies throughout the United States.
Previously, Mr. Roberts served as Principal with Lazard Group LLC (LAZ), a Senior Financial Analyst at Colony Capital, Inc., and a Financial
Analyst with the Corporate Finance Division of Smith Barney Inc. (now known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC).&nbsp; Mr. Roberts has

of are properly safeguarded, that the appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, and that our business is conducted wisely
and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. Included in these responsibilities is the board’s
oversight of the various risks facing us. In this regard, our board seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks. Our board
does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of our business strategy. Our board
recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential
for us to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.</p><div>

establishes committees, it is anticipated that much of the work will be delegated to such committees, which will meet regularly and report
back to the full board. It is anticipated that the audit committee will oversee risks related to our financial statements, the financial
reporting process, accounting and legal matters, that the compensation committee will evaluate the risks and rewards associated with

the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed two business acquisitions. On March 30, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of Wolo Mfg. Corp and Wolo Industrial Horn &amp; Signal, Inc., for an aggregate purchase price of $8,344,056.
On October 8, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of High Mountain Door &amp; Trim, Inc. and Sierra Homes
LLC, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $15,441,173. The Company accounted for these two acquisitions as business combinations.
Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the transaction dates.
The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the fair value of the consideration granted and identifiable
intangible assets acquired in each acquisition. We identified the estimation of the fair value of the consideration transferred, assets
acquired, and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions as a critical audit matter.</span></p><div>

identified the valuation of the consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed as a critical audit matter because
of the significant estimates and assumptions management made to determine the fair value of certain of these assets. This required a
high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of
valuation methodologies applied and the assumptions used such as forecasted sales growth rates, cash flows, attrition rates, market-based
royalty rates, and estimated discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.</span></p><div>

reporting date, the Company recognizes revenue over time, because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer as work is performed
at the customer’s site and, therefore, the customer controls the asset as it is being installed. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost
measure of progress method as it believes this best depicts the transfer of control of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs
are incurred. When this method is used, the Company estimates the costs to complete individual contracts and record as revenue that portion
of the total contract price that is considered complete based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to total anticipated costs.
Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs
at completion can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, cost of labor, and materials. Additionally, external factors such
as weather, and customer delays may affect the progress of a project’s completion, and thus the timing and amount of revenue recognition,
cash flow, and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation></span></ix:continuation></span><div>

installation and is received after satisfactory completion of each installation project. Management regularly reviews aging of&nbsp;retainage&nbsp;receivables
and changes in payment trends and records an allowance when collection of amounts due are considered at risk. The allowance for doubtful

of parts that are used in service and repairs and may or may not be charged to the customer depending on warranty and contractual relationship.
Kyle’s typically orders inventory on a job-by-job basis and those jobs are put into production within hours of being received. The
inventory in production is accounted for in the contract assets and liabilities and follows the percentage completion methodology. Inventories
consisting of materials and supplies are stated at lower of costs or market. High Mountain and Innovative Cabinets’ inventory mainly
consists of doors, door frames, baseboards, crown molding, cabinetry, countertops, custom cabinets, closet shelving, and other related
products. The Company values inventory at each balance sheet date to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable
value with cost determined based on the average cost basis. Wolo’s inventory consists of finished goods acquired for resale and
is valued at the weighted-average cost determined on a specific item basis. The Company periodically evaluates the value of items in inventory

useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for
impairment within one year of acquisitions or annually as of December 1, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The fair value
of intangible assets are compared with their carrying values, and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which a carrying

minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company
used its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value
of lease payments. A number of the lease agreements contain options to renew and options to terminate the leases early. The lease term
used to calculate ROU assets and lease liabilities only includes renewal and termination options that are deemed reasonably certain to

lease incentives provided by lessors. Operating lease cost is recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease
term and is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Variable lease payments for common area maintenance, property taxes
and other operating expenses are recognized as expense in the period when the changes in facts and circumstances on which the variable
lease payments are based occur. The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for all property leases for the

to delay or curtail expenditures or programs and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, among other factors. Based on

with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual
reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. This pronouncement was amended under&nbsp;ASU&nbsp;2019-10&nbsp;to
allow an extension on the adoption date for entities that qualify as a small reporting company. The Company has elected this extension
and the effective date for the Company to adopt this standard will be for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company
has not completed its assessment of the standard but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.</p></ix:continuation></span></ix:continuation></span><div>

The note bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum and was due and payable in full
on March 3, 2018. The note is unsecured and contains customary events of default. The note has not been repaid, so the Company is in
default under this note. Under terms of the term loan with Home State Bank described above, this note may not be paid until the term
loan is paid in full. The payees on the note agreed to the modification of its terms by signing the loan agreement for the Home State
Bank term loan. Accordingly, the loan is shown as a long-term liability as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, Home State Bank limits
the payment of interest on this note to $40,000 annually. The Company continued to accrue interest at the contract rate; however, given
the limitations of the term loan, all accrued interest in excess of $40,000 is included in long-term accrued expenses.</ix:nonnumeric></span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation></span><div>

the financing to complete the acquisition of Wolo shall receive the equity stake in Wolo. The Company is required to cause Kyle’s
and Wolo to grant to the holders of the series A senior convertible preferred shares upon the issuance to them of the Additional Equity
Interest a right to receive an additional number of shares of common stock of Kyle’s or Wolo if Kyle’s or Wolo issues to any
third-party equity securities at a price below the acquisition price (as defined below). Such additional number of shares of common stock
of Kyle’s or Wolo to be issued in such instance shall be equal to a number of shares of common stock of Kyle’s or Wolo which,
when added to the number of shares of common stock of Kyle’s or Wolo constituting the Additional Equity Interest, would be equal
to the total number of shares of common stock which would have been issued to a holder of series A senior convertible preferred shares
if the price per share of common stock of Kyle’s or Wolo was equivalent to the price per equity security paid by such third-party
in Kyle’s or Wolo. For purposes of this provision, “acquisition price” means the price per share of Kyle’s and
Wolo that was paid by the Company upon the acquisition of Kyle’s and Wolo, respectively.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation></span><div>
