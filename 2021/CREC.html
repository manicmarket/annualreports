to position itself as a partner of choice for leading Brazilian entrepreneurs and family-owned companies, adding significant value through
hands-on governance and strategic inputs, as well as providing capital for growth.</span></p><div>

rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together
have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting
commissions held in the trust account and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of signing the agreement
to enter into the initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our
initial business combination upon standards generally accepted by the financial community. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, or if we are considering an initial business combination with an
affiliated entity, such transaction would be subject to approval by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. We would
not be required to obtain an opinion from a third party firm in such event to address whether the business combination is fair to our
public shareholders from a financial point of view. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction
with our initial business combination. We also will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank
check company or a similar company with nominal operations. Subject to these limitations, our directors and executive officers will have
virtually unlimited flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses.</span></p><div>

may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with Crescera, or one or more parties affiliated with Crescera, including
without limitation officers and affiliates of Crescera, funds associated with Crescera or investors in such funds. Any such party may&nbsp;co-invest&nbsp;with
us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition
by borrowing from or issuing to such parties a class of equity or debt securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such

anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders
own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure
our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or
assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team
or shareholders or for other reasons. We will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or
acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on the
relative valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests
of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third parties in connection with financing our initial business combination.
In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number
of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and
outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business
or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned
or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target
business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target
businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.</span></p><div>

decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and officers becomes aware of
a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual
obligations (including, without limitation, any funds associated with Crescera or their current or former portfolio companies), then,
subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to
present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Crescera, funds associated
with Crescera or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment
ideas generated within or presented to Crescera or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Crescera, a current
or future Crescera fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations,
will first be directed to Crescera, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. However,
we do not expect these fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination
opportunities or to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except
and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities

any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may

amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could
acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the
purchase price exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public shareholders,
we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable
securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination.
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender
offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we
would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity
or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into in the future. At this time, we are not a party to any
arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Neither our sponsor, nor any of our officers, directors or shareholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with

the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection

already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or
any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any
other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange
Act and the other federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares

described above, we intend to require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders
or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their share certificates to our transfer
agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal
At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy
materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination.
In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a public shareholder seeking redemption
of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the scheduled vote
in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that
we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring
public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two business days prior
to the scheduled vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer
materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise
its redemption rights. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender
offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders
to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</span></p><div>

is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the
DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it
would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless
of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares
is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</span></p><div>

request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer
documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption
rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that
the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders
of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.</span></p><div>

we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm),
prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no
guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing
claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other
similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with
respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an
agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives
are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third
party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where
we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular
expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to
execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our IPO will not execute agreements with us waiving such
claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims
they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek
recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed
that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than Marcum LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered
into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of
funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i)&nbsp;$10.20 per unit and (ii)&nbsp;the actual amount per public share held in
the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per unit due to reductions in the
value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or
prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such
waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such
indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that
our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust
account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per unit. In
such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in
connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third
parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</span></p><div>

reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its
indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would
determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that
our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us,
it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance

the proceeds of our IPO with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation,
currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that
the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims
made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $650,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the
funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease
by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $650,000, the amount of

an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual
obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i)
no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain
from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any
interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate
opportunity for any director or officer on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties
or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.</span></p><div>

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy

of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they

earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of any
June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict
whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities
less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise
would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.</span></p><div>

standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such
extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or
private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new
or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of
the potential differences in accounting standards used.</span></p><div>

we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take

we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control

conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a
liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the
same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural
justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public
policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.</span></p><div>

of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were
structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, we would seek
shareholder approval of such business combination. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement, the decision
as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to
us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the
transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Even if we seek shareholder
approval, the holders of our founder shares will participate in the vote on such approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business
combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination we complete.</span></p><div>

expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may
be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for
the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience
in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.
Many of these competitors possess similar or greater technical, human and other resources to ours or more local industry knowledge than
we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe
there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the private placement
warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our
available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain
target businesses. In addition, as our strategy is to focus on business combination targets in Latin America, where there is a more limited
pool of targets, we may be unable to find a suitable business combination target. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our
public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder
vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.

may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be
paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to
satisfy other conditions. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing
condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions
payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination and such
amount of deferred underwriting discount is not available for us to use as consideration in an initial business combination. Furthermore,
in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting
commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination, or any greater net tangible asset or cash
requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly
submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less

as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and we may instead

the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption
rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted
for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the
purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust
account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for
redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust
account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence
of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision
of the Class B ordinary shares results in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
of the Class B ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting
commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business
combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced
by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation
to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business
combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.</span></p><div>

increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement
with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination,
where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection
with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination
that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act

to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent, or to deliver their shares to our transfer
agent electronically prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy

financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure

required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination for general corporate purposes,
including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination businesses, the payment of principal or interest

were temporarily issued to such officer and, on April 7, 2021, transferred to our sponsor. The purchase price of the founder shares was
determined by dividing the amount of expenses paid on behalf of the company by the number of founder shares issued. In October 2021, our
sponsor received a further 958,333 founder shares by way of share capitalization using the existing share premium account. The number
of founder shares outstanding was determined based on our IPO of 20,125,000 and therefore the corresponding 6,708,333 founder shares represent
approximately 25% of the outstanding shares. Out of the 6,708,333 founder shares, 5,031,250 founder shares will convert into Class A ordinary
shares after our initial business combination and 1,677,083 founder shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares only to the extent
our stock trades at or above $12.50 per share as described in the final prospectus. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not
complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has  purchased an aggregate of 10,150,000 private placement
warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $10,150,000, or $1.00 per warrant. The private placement warrants will also be worthless if
we do not complete our initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence

in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with
other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the

impacted as a result of such increase or decrease. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $650,000,
the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced
to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds
to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to
us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $2,100,000 of such loans may be convertible into private placement warrants
of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide
a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination
because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently,
our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.20 per unit, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our

target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors
outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later
write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses.
Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize
in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate
impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our
securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result
of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the initial
business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders
following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders or warrant holders are
unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach
by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private

enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds

our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with
such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the

our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial

us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less

claims by a third party (other than Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold
to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement

third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether
or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification
obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe
that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to
satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our
initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per unit. In such event, we may not be able to complete

our efforts to identify a prospective initial business combination target will not be limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic
region in Latin America. While we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize
on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business or businesses that can benefit from our management team’s
established global relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in strategy and finance, including
companies in sectors with strong growth potential benefiting from positive trends in the region, including, but not limited to, healthcare,
technology, education services, consumer and retail. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prohibit us from
effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet
selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible
merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition
or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business
operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established
record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development
stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot
assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete
due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances
that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove
to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly,
any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities.
Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction
was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully
bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business
combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</p><div>

50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for
us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that
does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our
shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue
a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests
of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination
or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case,
we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares,
our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares
subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single
person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more

and the underwriting agreement contain certain lock-up provisions with respect to the founder shares, private placement warrants and other
securities held by our initial shareholders, sponsor, officers and directors. Amendments to such agreements would require the consent
of the applicable parties thereto and would need to be approved by our board of directors, which may do so for a variety of reasons, including
to facilitate our initial business combination. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these

other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding
or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash
items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the
post-business combination business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit
from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.</p><div>

United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity
of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in
other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted
at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or
private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act. Our initial public is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities.
The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i)&nbsp;the completion of our initial
business combination; (ii)&nbsp;the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)&nbsp;to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow
redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by May 23, 2023 (or November 23, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination
in accordance with the terms described in our final prospectus) or (B)&nbsp;with respect to any other material provisions relating to

2023 (or November 23, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms
described in our final prospectus), our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption
of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act.
If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional
expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that
are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.</p><div>

have the option, in our sole discretion, to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis under certain
circumstances described in the prospectus for our IPO. If we choose to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis or
if holders elect to do so when there is no effective registration statement, the number of Class A ordinary shares received by a holder
upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his or her warrant for cash. For example, if the holder
is exercising 875 public warrants at $11.50 per share through a cashless exercise when the Class A ordinary shares have a fair market
value of $17.50 per share when there is no effective registration statement, then upon the cashless exercise, the holder will receive
300 Class A ordinary shares. The holder would have received 875 Class A ordinary shares if the exercise price was paid in cash. This will
have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company because the warrant holder
will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold.</p><div>

the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in
the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration
rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target
business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact
on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares that is expected when the ordinary shares owned by our initial shareholders, holders
of our private placement warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered.</p><div>

two taxable years following our current taxable year). Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we will endeavor

representing 20% of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the consummation of such blank check company’s IPO. We have
issued 6,708,333 founder shares, of which 5,031,250 will convert into Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares after our initial business combination
and 1,677,083 will convert into Class A ordinary shares only to the extent our stock trades at or above $12.50 per share as described
in this prospectus. In addition, we may be required to issue 10,150,000 Class A ordinary shares as shares underlying our private placement
warrants held by our sponsor. If following our initial business combination all of the founder shares convert into our Class A ordinary
shares and all of the private placement warrants are exercised, our initial shareholders will hold approximately 62.8% of the total ordinary
shares issued and outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all founder shares that have not been converted to Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares on the second anniversary of our initial business combination will be exchanged on such date, at the Company’s election,
for an aggregate for all such founder shares of either (i)&nbsp;100 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or (ii)&nbsp;cash, in an amount equal
to the value of 100 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, based on the average market price of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares over the period of
five trading days ending two trading days before the date of exchange. If all of our founder shares convert into our Class A ordinary
shares, the issuance of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares upon conversion of such shares would dilute the interest of our shareholders relative
to shareholders of other blank check companies.</p><div>

special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments,
including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination,
increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants,
amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of at least two-thirds of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant
agreement will require a vote of holders of at least a majority of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the
terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, a majority
of the then outstanding private placement warrants (except for provisions of the warrant agreement enabling amendments without shareholder
approval or warrant holder that are necessary or advisable in the good faith determination of our board of directors (taking into account
then existing market precedents) to allow for the warrants to be classified as equity in our financial statements, provided that any modifications
or amendments that would increase the warrant price or shorten the exercise period shall require the approval of the warrant holders in
accordance with the warrant agreement). In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require us to provide
our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A)&nbsp;to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection
with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by

in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company’s pre-business

and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement
to deposit proceeds from our IPO and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified
circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution
under Cayman Islands law which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of at least two-thirds of the shareholders who attend and vote

of economic contraction, political instability, civil strife, organized crime, corruption and other adverse conditions. The economies
of these countries are susceptible to fluctuations in certain global commodity prices and are also impacted by adverse developments in
other markets. Additionally, countries in the region tend to have significant physical and digital infrastructure deficiencies, as compared
to the United States. Governments in Latin America have in the past made significant policy and regulatory shifts in response to social
pressures, including changes in taxation. Moreover, these governments have, at times, exercised a significant degree of control over the
private sector, including due to possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions. We

degrees, market conditions in other emerging markets, as well as the United States, Europe and other countries. To the extent the conditions
of the global markets or economy deteriorate, the business of companies with significant operations in Latin America may be harmed. The
weakness in the global economy has been marked by, among other adverse factors, lower levels of consumer and corporate confidence, decreased
business investment and consumer spending, increased unemployment, reduced income and asset values in many areas, reduction of China’s
growth rate, currency volatility and limited availability of credit and access to capital, in addition to significant uncertainty results
from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Developments or economic conditions in other emerging market countries have at times significantly
affected the availability of credit to companies with significant operations in Latin America and resulted in considerable outflows of
funds from Latin American countries, decreasing the amount of foreign investments in the region.</p><div>

market countries, the United States, Europe or other countries, including increased international trade tensions and protectionist policies,
could decrease investor demand for securities offered by companies with significant operations in Brazil and Latin America, such as our
Class A ordinary shares. For example, in 2019, political and social unrest in Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia
and Colombia, sparked political demonstrations and, in some instances, violence. In October 2019, presidential elections were held in
Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina. Controversial outcomes in Bolivia and Uruguay led to violent protests and claims of fraudulent elections
in Bolivia and a runoff election in Uruguay. Similarly, Chile experienced political unrest and social strife, including a wave of protests
and riots, beginning on October&nbsp;18, 2019, sparked by an increase in the subway fare of the Santiago Metro and widened to reflect
anger over living costs and inequality. These developments, as well as potential crises and other forms of political instability or any
other as of yet unforeseen development, may harm our business and the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares.</p><div>

the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or “NATO.” Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine beginning on
February 24, 2022, the United States, the UK, the EU and other countries announced broad economic sanctions against Russia, including
financial measures such as freezing Russia’s central bank assets, limiting its ability to access its dollar reserves, the US, the
EU and the UK have also banned people and businesses from dealings with the Russian central bank, its finance ministry and its wealth
funds, selected Russian banks will also be removed from Swift messaging system, which enables the smooth transfer of money across borders.
Other sanctions by the UK include major Russian banks from the UK financial system, stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing
payments, excluding major Russian companies and the state will be stopped from raising finances or borrowing money on the UK markets,
and establishment of limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks. The US, the EU and the UK adopted personal measures, such as sanctions
on individuals with close ties to Mr. Putin, and placed visa restrictions on several oligarchs, as well as their family members and close
associates, and froze their assets.</p><div>

face continued volatility as well as economic and security consequences including, but not limited to, supply shortages of different kinds,
increases in prices of commodities, including piped gas, oil and agricultural goods, among others. Given that Russia and Ukraine are among
the largest grain exporters in the world, impacts on financial markets, inflation, interest rates, unemployment and other matters could
affect the global economy that is currently recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, these effects could result
in increased inflation in Brazil and in measures by the Brazilian government to contain inflation, such as raising the basic interest
rate, which could materially impact the cost of debt and third-party capital for financing and investing activities across industries.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The recent economic instability in Brazil have
contributed to a decline in market confidence in the Brazilian economy. Various ongoing investigations into allegations of money laundering
and corruption being conducted by the Office of the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor, including the largest of such investigations, known
as “<i>Operação Lava Jato</i>,” have negatively impacted the Brazilian economy and political environment. The
potential outcome of these investigations is uncertain, but they have already had an adverse impact on the image and reputation of the
implicated companies, and on the general market perception of the Brazilian economy. We cannot predict whether the ongoing investigations
will result in further political and economic instability, or if new allegations against government officials and/or executives of private
companies will arise in the future. A number of senior politicians, including current and former members of Congress and the Executive
Branch, and high-ranking executive officers of major corporations and state-owned companies in Brazil were arrested, convicted of various
charges relating to corruption, entered into plea agreements with federal prosecutors and/or have resigned or been removed from their
positions as a result of these Lava Jato investigations. These individuals are alleged to have accepted bribes by means of kickbacks on
contracts granted by the government to several infrastructure, oil and gas and construction companies. The profits of these kickbacks
allegedly financed the political campaigns of political parties, for which funds were unaccounted or not publicly disclosed. These funds
were also allegedly directed toward the personal enrichment of certain individuals. The effects of Lava Jato as well as other ongoing
corruption-related investigations resulted in an adverse impact on the image and reputation of the companies that have been implicated
as well as on the general market perception of the Brazilian economy, political environment and capital markets. We have no control over,
and cannot predict, whether such investigations or allegations will lead to further political and economic instability or whether new
allegations against government officials will arise in the future.</p><div>

government may propose certain reforms to stimulate the economy and reduce the forecasted budget deficit for 2021 and following years,
but it is uncertain whether the Brazilian government will be able to gather the required support in the Brazilian Congress to pass additional

might have on our business and on the Brazilian economy. In addition, the Brazilian government is incurring significant levels of debt
to finance measures to combat the&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic which is expected to increase the Brazilian budget deficit. Any new policies
or changes to current policies, including measures to combat the&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, may have a material adverse impact on our

(<i>Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo</i>), or IPCA, which is published by the Brazilian Institute for Geography
and Statistics (<i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística</i>), or IBGE, Brazilian inflation rates were 10.1%, 4.5% and
4.3% for the years ended as of December&nbsp;31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brazil may experience high levels of inflation in
the future and inflationary pressures may lead to the Brazilian government’s intervening in the economy and introducing policies
that could harm our business and the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. One of the tools used by the Brazilian government to
control inflation levels is its monetary policy, specifically relating to interest rates. An increase in the interest rate restricts the
availability of credit and reduces economic growth, and vice versa. During recent years there has been significant volatility in the official
Brazilian interest rate, which ranged from 14.25% on December&nbsp;31, 2015, to 2.00% on December&nbsp;31, 2020. This rate is set by the
Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank (<i>Comitê de Política Monetária</i>), or COPOM. On February&nbsp;7,
2018, the Monetary Policy Committee reduced the base interest rate (<i>Sistema Especial de Liquidação e Custódia</i>,
or SELIC rate) to 6.75% and further reduced the SELIC rate to 6.50% on March&nbsp;22, 2018. The Monetary Policy Committee reconfirmed
the SELIC rate of 6.50% on May&nbsp;16, 2018 and subsequently on June&nbsp;20, 2018. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018, the SELIC rate was
6.50%. The Monetary Policy Committee reconfirmed the SELIC rate of 6.50% on February&nbsp;6, 2019, but reduced the SELIC rate to 6.00%
on August&nbsp;1, 2019, further reduced the rate to 5.50% on October&nbsp;30, 2019 and further reduced the rate to 4.50% on December&nbsp;12,
2019. On February&nbsp;6, 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee reduced the SELIC rate to 4.25%, on March&nbsp;19, 2020, further reduced
the rate to 3.75%, on May 7, 2020, further reduced the rate to 3.00%, on June 18, 2020, further reduced the rate to 2.25% and on August&nbsp;6,
2020, further reduced the rate to 2.00%. On March 18, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the SELIC rate to 2.75% and further raised
the rate to 3.50% on May 5, 2021, to 5.25% on August 4, 2021, to 6.25% on September 22, 2021, to 7.75% on October 28, 2021, to 9.25% as
of December 19, 2021, to 10.75% on February 2, 2022 and to 11.75% on March 16, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, the SELIC rate was 11.75%.
Conversely, more lenient government and Central Bank policies and interest rate decreases have triggered and may continue to trigger increases
in inflation and, consequently, growth volatility and the need for sudden and significant interest rate increases, which could negatively
affect us and increase our target business indebtedness. Any change in interest rates, in particular any volatile swings, could adversely
affect our growth, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our target business.</p><div>

is considered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP. Although inflation rates in certain of the other countries in which we operate have
been relatively low in the recent past, we cannot assure you that this trend will continue. The measures taken by the governments of these
countries to control inflation have often included maintaining a tight monetary policy with high interest rates, thereby restricting the
availability of credit and retarding economic growth. Inflation, measures to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional
actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in many of these countries and to heightened volatility in their securities
markets. Periods of higher inflation may also slow the growth rate of local economies that could lead to reduced demand for the products
and services of our target business. Inflation is also likely to increase some costs and expenses of our target business, which the target
business may not be able to fully pass on to customers and which could adversely affect our operating margins and operating income.</p><div>

Brazilian currency has been historically volatile and has been devalued frequently over the past three decades. Throughout this period,
the Brazilian government has implemented various economic plans and used various exchange rate policies, including sudden devaluations,
periodic mini-devaluations (during which the frequency of adjustments has ranged from daily to monthly), exchange controls, dual exchange
rate markets and a floating exchange rate system. Although long-term depreciation of the Brazilian <i>real</i> is generally linked to
the rate of inflation in Brazil, depreciation of the <i>real</i> occurring over shorter periods of time has resulted in significant variations
in the exchange rate between the <i>real</i>, the U.S. dollar and other currencies. In 2014, the <i>real</i> depreciated by 11% against
the U.S. dollar, while in 2015 it further depreciated by 45%. The <i>real</i>/U.S. dollar exchange rate reported by the Central Bank was
R$3.259 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2016, an appreciation of 19% against the rate of R$3.905 per US$1.00 reported on December&nbsp;31,
2015. In 2017, the <i>real</i> depreciated by 1%, with the exchange rate reaching R$3.308 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2017. In 2018,
the <i>real</i> depreciated an additional 18%, to R$3.875 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2018. In 2019, the <i>real</i> depreciated
an additional 4% to R$4.031 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2019. The <i>real</i>/U.S. dollar exchange rate reported by the Central Bank
was R$5.197 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2020, which reflected a 29% depreciation of the <i>real</i> against the U.S. dollar during
2020 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Brazilian economy. The <i>real</i>/U.S. dollar exchange rate reported
by the Central Bank was R$5.581 per US$1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2021, which reflected a 7% depreciation of the <i>real</i> against the
U.S. dollar during 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Brazilian economy. As of March 30, 2022, the <i>real</i>/U.S.
dollar exchange rate reported by the Central Bank was R$4.749 per US$1.00, an appreciation of 14.9% of the <i>real</i> since December&nbsp;31,
2021. There can be no assurance that the <i>real</i> will not appreciate or further depreciate against the U.S. dollar or other currencies
in the future.</p><div>

has tightened restrictions on capital flows and imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions, substantially limiting the ability
of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments outside of Argentina. Furthermore, the Central Bank of Argentina implemented
regulations requiring its prior approval for certain foreign exchange transactions otherwise authorized to be carried out under the applicable
regulations, such as dividend payments or repayment of principal of inter-company loans as well as the import of goods. As a consequence
of the re-imposition of exchange controls, the spread between the official exchange rate and other exchange rates resulting implicitly
from certain capital market operations usually effected to obtain U.S. dollars has broadened significantly. The implementation of the
above-mentioned measures could impact our ability to transfer funds outside of Argentina in the future and may prevent or delay payments
that Argentine portfolio companies may be required to make outside Argentina, if any. As a result, if we are prohibited from transferring
funds out of Argentina, or if we become subject to similar restrictions in other countries in which we operate, our results of operations
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the continuing devaluation of the Argentine peso since the
end of 2015 has led to higher inflation levels, has significantly reduced competitiveness, real wages and consumption and has had a negative
impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand and supplies payable in foreign currency. Further currency devaluations

to have a negative impact on global, regional and national economies and to disrupt supply chains and otherwise reduce international trade
and business activity. Reflecting this, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused, since February 2020, the levels of equity and other
financial markets to decline sharply and to become volatile, and such effects may continue or worsen in the future. This may in turn further
impact the stock market and private equity markets in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, which may impact our future business in Latin
America and our resulting business combination operations. The market declines and volatility could negatively impact our operations causing
us to incur losses as well as result in the postponement or cancellation of expansion plans or mergers and acquisitions thereby reducing
our future growth prospects, among others. The economic slowdown and market downturn could also negatively impact our target business
performance through lower demand for its products or services and higher than expected losses, potentially leading our investors to redirect
investments away from us. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact on the global economy may affect our ability to meet
our financial targets or business combination. While it is too early for us to predict the impacts on our target business or our financial
targets that the pandemic, and the governmental responses to it, may have, we would be materially adversely affected by a protracted downturn

with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The

Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an
Entity’s Own Equity, to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible debt and other equity-linked instruments. For
certain convertible debt instruments with a cash conversion feature, the changes are a trade-off between simplifications in the
accounting model (no separation of an “equity” component to impute a market interest rate, and simpler analysis of
embedded equity features) and a potentially adverse impact to diluted EPS by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The new
standard will also impact other financial instruments commonly issued by both public and private companies. For example, the
separation model for beneficial conversion features is eliminated simplifying the analysis for issuers of convertible debt and
convertible preference shares. Also, certain specific requirements to achieve equity classification and/ or qualify for the
derivative scope exception for contracts indexed to an entity’s own equity are removed, enabling more freestanding instruments
and embedded features to avoid mark-to-market accounting. The new standard is effective for companies that are SEC filers (except
for Smaller Reporting Companies) for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within that year, and two
years later for other companies. Companies can early adopt the standard at the start of a fiscal year beginning after December 15,
2020. The standard can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or a full retrospective basis. The Company has adopted and the
effects are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements.</p><div>

as a partner, shareholder, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). We have three “independent

were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination
will be made from funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not

extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification

provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred
in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We expect to purchase a policy
of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement

There are three managers of CC Sponsor LLC’s board of managers: Jaime Cardoso Danvila, Daniel Arthur Borghi and Felipe Samuel Argalji.
Each manager of CC Sponsor LLC has one vote, and the approval of two of the three members of the board of managers is required to approve
an action of CC Sponsor LLC. Under the so-called “rule of three,” if voting and dispositive decisions regarding an entity’s
securities are made by two or more individuals, and a voting and dispositive decision requires the approval of a majority of those individuals,
then none of the individuals is deemed a beneficial owner of the entity’s securities. This is the case with regard to CC Sponsor
LLC. Based upon the foregoing analysis, no individual manager of CC Sponsor LLC exercises voting or dispositive control over any of the
securities held by CC Sponsor LLC even those in which he directly holds a pecuniary interest. Accordingly, none of them will be deemed
to have or share beneficial ownership of such shares and, for the avoidance of doubt, each expressly disclaims any such beneficial interest
to the extent of any pecuniary interest he may have therein, directly or indirectly.</td></tr></tbody></table><div>

or 1% of the average of the company’s total assets at year end for the prior two completed fiscal years in the aggregate over the
duration of the transaction (without regard to profit or loss); and (iii)&nbsp;in which a “related party” had, has or will
have a direct or indirect material interest. “Related parties” under this policy will include: (i)&nbsp;our directors, or
officers; (ii)&nbsp;any record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities; (iii)&nbsp;any immediate family
member of any of the foregoing if the foregoing person is a natural person; and (iv)&nbsp;any other person who maybe a “related
person” pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the policy, the audit committee will consider
(i)&nbsp;the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to
those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party, (ii)&nbsp;the extent of the related party’s
interest in the transaction, (iii)&nbsp;whether the transaction contravenes our code of ethics or other policies, (iv)&nbsp;whether the
audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and
(v)&nbsp;the effect that the transaction may have on a director’s status as an independent member of the board and on his or her
eligibility to serve on the board’s committees. Management will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction,
including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if
our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not
permit any director or officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or
she is the related party.</p><div>

changes in ordinary shares subject to possible redemption and shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for the period from March 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the period from March 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due
to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.</p><div>

misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p><div>

Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company

any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means
that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of the Company’s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth
company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting

to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible debt and other equity-linked instruments. For certain convertible debt instruments
with a cash conversion feature, the changes are a trade-off between simplifications in the accounting model (no separation of an “equity”
component to impute a market interest rate, and simpler analysis of embedded equity features) and a potentially adverse impact to diluted
EPS by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will also impact other financial instruments commonly issued by
both public and private companies. For example, the separation model for beneficial conversion features is eliminated simplifying the
analysis for issuers of convertible debt and convertible preference shares. Also, certain specific requirements to achieve equity classification
and/ or qualify for the derivative scope exception for contracts indexed to an entity’s own equity are removed, enabling more freestanding
instruments and embedded features to avoid mark-to-market accounting. The new standard is effective for companies that are SEC filers
(except for Smaller Reporting Companies) for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within that year, and
two years later for other companies. Companies can early adopt the standard at the start of a fiscal year beginning after December 15,
2020. The standard can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or a full retrospective basis. The Company adopted the new standard
upon incorporation and the impact to the Company’s balance sheet, statement of operations, and statement of cash flows was not material.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation></ix:continuation><div>

volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimated the volatility of its Public Warrants based
on implied volatility from the Company’s traded warrants and from historical volatility of select peer company’s Class A ordinary
shares that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury&nbsp;zero-coupon&nbsp;yield
curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed
to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates
remaining at zero.</p><p style="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation><div>
