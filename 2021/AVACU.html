tools, and new investment markets, such as clean energy, carbon credits and other sustainable products.</p>

anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders
shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses.
We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than
100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target
business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination
if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires
a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires
50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a
minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination
transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100%
controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders
immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are
owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what
will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business,

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif">As
an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger
or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for
example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock
(or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration
to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective
method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes
a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses
in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same
extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the
target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s
ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring
or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital,
an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares
as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential
new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</span></p>

The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally
accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board
of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed.
In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying
on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide stockholders with our analysis

another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect
to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction

the board is less familiar or experienced with the partner company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to
the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth,
or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside
expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair
market value of the partner business meets the 80% of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the
valuation of a partner business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed
to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the

will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares of Class A common

the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval
of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be
based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us
to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock
purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any
transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in
a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the
proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules
of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder
approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will
be required to comply with such rules.</span></p>

non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in
addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need 8,100,428, or 39.1%, of the 20,700,000 public shares sold
in our public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination
approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we

the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection
with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our certificate of incorporation will provide that a
public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in
concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption
rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks
of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed
business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current
market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15%
of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are
not purchased by us, our sponsor, or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering without our
prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability
to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our
stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.</span></p>

stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street

the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer
agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option,
in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation
or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial
business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial
holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time
we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote
on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise
its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and,
in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the
stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance
of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given
the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery
of their public shares.</span></p>

is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering
them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and
it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred
regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver
shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</span></p>

foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection
with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an
initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy
card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved,
the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As
a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which
he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she
could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation.
As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become
“option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate.
The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder’s election to redeem
is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.</span></p>

request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal
to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its
certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect
to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed
promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.</span></p>

that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims
against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar
claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect
to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement
waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available
to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such
third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where
we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular
expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to
execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Maxim will not
execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that
such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public
shares, if we have not completed an initial business combination within the completion window, or upon the exercise of a redemption
right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that
were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption. In order to protect the amounts held

services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target

the lesser of (i) $10.15 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date

each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any
claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust
account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the initial public offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However,
we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our
sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities
of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers
or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target
businesses.</span></p>

estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the
reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for
claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received
by any such stockholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,225,000, we may fund such excess with
funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust

by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption
of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered
a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of
the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during
which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any
claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability
of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the

if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in

under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings
that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the
statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of
three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion
window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not
more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released
to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to
receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject
to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our
obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it
is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 15th month and, therefore, we do not
intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of
distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary

from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups

well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire
larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage
in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders
who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding

will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging
growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance
with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls
of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any

are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As
such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other
public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or to provide a supplement to the auditor’s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding
a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously
approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our
securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.</span></p>

addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.</span></p>

Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than

be required to issue a higher percentage of our shares to the target or its stockholders to make up for the failure to satisfy

many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies

addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with

cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such
as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close
business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate
or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate

the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise
their redemption rights, and, therefore, we will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number
of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of
the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need
to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition,
if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction
to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for additional third-party financing. Raising additional
third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels.
The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize
our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for
any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination and such amount of deferred underwriting discount
is not available for us to use as consideration in an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to
stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions and after
such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions.</span></p>

December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing
to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe. On January 30, 2020, the World
Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On
January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States
to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to the coronavirus, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized
the outbreak as a “pandemic.” A significant outbreak of the coronavirus and other infectious diseases could result in
a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, business operations and
the conduct of commerce generally and could have a material adverse effect on the business of any potential target business with
which we complete a business combination. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns
relating to the coronavirus restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s
personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and complete a transaction in a timely manner. The extent
to which the coronavirus impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain
and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and the
actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by the coronavirus or other matters
of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete
a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. In addition,
our ability to complete a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic
and other related events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise adequate financing.</span></p>

a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing
of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases
of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the

completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant

Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial

businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses.

risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even

the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held
in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an
agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be
significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition

that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we

all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have
we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’

timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’ best interest. If this were the case, it
would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Delaware law and we or our stockholders might have a claim against
such individuals for infringing on our stockholders’ rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may
make against them for such reason.</span></p>

opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our
initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions
concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting,
any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met
our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested

independent valuation or accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business
combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or

business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete

example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be
affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers

of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely
impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to
investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholder
or warrant holder who chooses to remain a stockholder or warrant holder, respectively, following our initial business combination could
suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction
in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of
care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy
solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement

the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or

of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in
other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted
at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or
private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities.
The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial
business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide public stockholders the right
to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights
of holders of shares of our Class A common stock, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial
business within the completion window, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. If we do not invest the proceeds as
discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company
Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may
hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time
period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation
of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.</p>

Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which
are referred to as “covered securities.” Because our units, Class A common stock, and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq, our
units, Class A common stock and warrants qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating
the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and,
if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.
While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies,
other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers,
or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer
listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute, and we would be subject to regulation
in each state in which we offer our securities.</p>

price of our Class A common stock as reported during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of

then upon the cashless exercise, the holder will receive 300 shares of our Class A common stock. The holder would have received

Class A common stock to redeem the warrants or upon conversion of the Class B common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,

instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our certificate of incorporation
or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders
may not support. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds,
changed industry focus and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for
cash and/or other securities. Generally, amendments to our certificate of incorporation will require the approval of holders of 50% of
our common stock, and amendments to our warrant agreement that the parties deem adversely affect the interest of the public warrant holders
will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants. In addition, our certificate of incorporation will require us to
provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our certificate
of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business
combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the completion window
or with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent
any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement,
we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to
amend our charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt">Some other blank check companies
have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company’s
pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the company’s stockholders. In those companies, amendment
of these provisions typically requires approval by 90% of the company’s stockholders attending and voting at an annual meeting.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity
(including the requirement to deposit proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account
and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein)
may be amended if approved by holders of 50% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement
governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 50% of our common stock entitled
to vote thereon. In all other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority
of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange
rules. Our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, who will collectively beneficially own, on an as converted basis,
20% of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in our initial public
offering and excluding the representative shares), will participate in any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation and/or trust
agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our certificate
of incorporation which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase

the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor has invested in us an aggregate of $8,125,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase
price for the founder shares and the $8,100,000 purchase price for the private placement warrants. Assuming a trading price of $10.00
per share upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 5,175,000 founder shares would have an aggregate implied value of
$51,750,000. Even if the trading price of our common stock was as low as $1.57 per share, and the private placement warrants were worthless,
the value of the founder shares would be equal to our sponsor’s initial investment in us. As a result, our sponsor is likely to
be able to recoup its investment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares have lost significant
value. Accordingly, our management team, which owns interests in our sponsor, may have an economic incentive that differs from that of
the public stockholders to pursue and consummate an initial business combination rather than to liquidate and to return all of the cash
in the trust to the public stockholders, even if that business combination were with a riskier or less-established target business. For
the foregoing reasons, you should consider our management team’s financial incentive to complete an initial business combination
when evaluating whether to redeem your shares prior to or in connection with the initial business combination.</span></p>

Holders of founder shares have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (B)

the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to
profitably operate such business. We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which
our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will
only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet
such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders
prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock, shares, or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However,
as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of our Class A common stock, our stockholders immediately prior
to such transaction could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock subsequent to such transaction.
In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining
a larger share of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management

to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any

us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the
State of Delaware, except any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable
party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or

comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We
have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has

window. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going

discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:</span></p>

redemption (if any) is classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class&nbsp;A common
stock (including Class&nbsp;A common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject
to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times,
Class&nbsp;A common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity.</p>

are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of our balance sheets. Effective
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount, which, resulted
in charges against additional&nbsp;paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit.</p>

should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is&nbsp;re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.</p>

the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities
are subject to&nbsp;re-measurement&nbsp;at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our
statements of operations. The fair value of warrants issued in connection with the IPO and the private placement warrants was initially
measured at fair value by an independent valuation consultant using a market-based approach of comparable blank check company warrant
pricing. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the public warrants was based on observable closing market price for such warrants, and
value of the private warrants was fair valued based on the pricing of the public warrants.</p>

controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive
officer and chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2021, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers

do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute
assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls
and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.</span></p>

a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial
point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Furthermore, in no event will either of our sponsor
or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by the company any finder’s fee, consulting
fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination.
Further, we will also reimburse our sponsor for office space and administrative support services provided to us in the amount of $10,000
per month.</p>

These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of

Avalon Acquisition Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, changes in
stockholders’ (deficit)/equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the period from October 12, 2020 (inception)
through December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the period from October 12, 2020 (inception)

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable
to complete a business combination by January 8, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating.
The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p>

of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)

rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through one
year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying
existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence
on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.</p>

firm attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted

of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt
out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application
dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the
time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements
with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of
using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</p>

are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred

(“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet
the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under
ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own shares, among other conditions for equity classification.
This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent

paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value of the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.
Costs associated with issuing the warrants classified as derivative liabilities are charged to operations when the warrants are
issued.</p>

in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)” (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments.
ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible
instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s
own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed
to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement
to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for smaller reporting companies
and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on the condensed financial statements.</p>

outstanding. The Company accounts for the Public and Private Placement Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC
815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant
must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value and charges
the costs associated with issuing such warrants to operations. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires
that the Company records a derivative liability upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Accordingly, the Company has
classified the warrants as a liability at their fair value and allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units
to the warrants. This liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability
is adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The Company
reassesses the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period,
the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification.</p>

guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting

Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received
in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities,
the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the
use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following
fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in
order to value the assets and liabilities:</p>

markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for

Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities,
the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date,
with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including
whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion
of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.</p>

for the warrants on October 8, 2021, the date of the Company’s Initial Public Offering, using a market-based approach for
the Private Placement Warrants and the Public Warrants. <span style="color: black">The Company allocated the proceeds received
from (i)&nbsp;the sale of Units (which is inclusive of one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock and&nbsp;three-fourth&nbsp;of one
Public Warrant), (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, and (iii)&nbsp;the issuance of Class&nbsp;B common stock, first
to the Warrants based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to Class&nbsp;A
common stock subject to possible redemption (temporary equity), Class&nbsp;A common stock (permanent equity) and Class&nbsp;B
common stock (permanent equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. The Warrants were classified
as Level&nbsp;3 at the initial measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs. On October 8, 2021, the Private Placement
Warrants and Public Warrants were determined to have aggregate values of $<span id="xdx_90D_ecustom--PlacementWarrants_iI_pn3n3_dm_c20211008_zjRAy6foQUb1" title="Placement Warrants"><ix:nonfraction name="AVACU:PlacementWarrants" contextref="AsOf2021-10-08" format="ixt:numdotdecimal" decimals="-3" scale="6" unitref="USD">4.78</ix:nonfraction></span> million and $<span id="xdx_90B_ecustom--PublicWarrants_iI_pn3n3_dm_c20211008_zXjYyVZcdNQk" title="Public Warrants"><ix:nonfraction name="AVACU:PublicWarrants" contextref="AsOf2021-10-08" format="ixt:numdotdecimal" decimals="-3" scale="6" unitref="USD">9.16</ix:nonfraction></span> million, respectively.</span></p>

on a recurring basis. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants as of December&nbsp;31, 2021 is classified as Level&nbsp;1
due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker AVACW. As the transfer of Private Placement
Warrants to anyone outside of a small group of individuals who are permitted transferees would result in the Private Placement
Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined that the fair value of each Private
Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant, with an insignificant adjustment for short-term marketability
restrictions. As such, the Private Placement Warrants are classified as Level&nbsp;2. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate values
of the Private Placement Warrants and Public Warrants were $<span id="xdx_907_ecustom--PlacementWarrants_iI_pn3n3_dm_c20211231_zOMt5MvTyw7j"><ix:nonfraction name="AVACU:PlacementWarrants" contextref="AsOf2021-12-31" format="ixt:numdotdecimal" decimals="-3" scale="6" unitref="USD">3.16</ix:nonfraction></span> million and $<span id="xdx_902_ecustom--PublicWarrants_iI_pn3n3_dm_c20211231_zUhSu8LvYuzj"><ix:nonfraction name="AVACU:PublicWarrants" contextref="AsOf2021-12-31" format="ixt:numdotdecimal" decimals="-3" scale="6" unitref="USD">6.05</ix:nonfraction></span> million, respectively.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.5pt">In assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration
of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the
deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance.</p>
