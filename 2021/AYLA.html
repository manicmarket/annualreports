oncology company focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics for patients suffering from rare and
aggressive cancers. Our differentiated development approach is predicated on identifying and addressing tumorigenic drivers of
cancer, through a combination of our bioinformatics platform and next-generation sequencing to deliver targeted therapies to
underserved patient populations. Our current portfolio of product candidates, AL101 and AL102, targets the aberrant activation of
the Notch pathway using gamma secretase inhibitors. Gamma secretase is the enzyme responsible for Notch activation and, when
inhibited, turns off the Notch pathway activation. Aberrant activation of the Notch pathway has long been implicated in multiple
solid tumor and hematological cancers and has often been associated with more aggressive cancers. In cancers, Notch is known to
serve as a critical facilitator in processes such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and
metastatic spread, all of which contribute to a poorer patient prognosis. AL101 and AL102 are designed to address the underlying key
drivers of tumor growth, and our initial Phase 2 clinical data of AL101 suggest that our approach may address shortcomings of
existing treatment options. We believe that our novel product candidates, if approved, have the potential to transform treatment
outcomes for patients suffering from rare and aggressive cancers.</p><div>

are being developed as potent, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitors, or GSIs. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide license
to develop and commercialize AL101 and AL102 from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, in November 2017. BMS evaluated AL101 in three
Phase 1 studies involving more than 200 total subjects and AL102 in a single Phase 1 study involving 36 subjects with various cancers
who had not been prospectively characterized for Notch activation, and to whom we refer to as unselected subjects. While these Phase 1
studies did not report statistically significant overall results, clinical activity was observed across these studies in cancers in which
Notch has been implicated as a tumorigenic driver.</p><div>

rare, disfiguring and often debilitating types of soft tissue tumors. Desmoid tumors have an annual incidence of approximately 1,700
patients in the United States. There are currently no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA for
patients with desmoid tumors. Given the slowly progressive nature of the disease, we believe these patients will be best served by
an oral therapy. BMS conducted a Phase 1 study of AL102 in 36 subjects with heavily pretreated unselected solid tumors. While this
Phase 1 study did not report statistically significant overall results, the study included one subject with desmoid tumors who was
observed to have SD for over six months. In a separate Phase 1 study of AL101, three Desmoid subjects were included, and two of
these subjects had partial responses and have continued treatment in a post-trial expanded access protocol, and both maintained
their responses, and one subject had stable disease. These results were published in Current Oncology in September 2021. We believe
that GSIs have the potential to treat patients with desmoid tumors based on the data we have obtained to date.</p><div>

is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AL102 in adult and adolescent patients with desmoid tumors. Part A of
the study is an open-label and completed the enrollment of 36 patients with progressive desmoid tumors in three study arms across three
doses of AL102: 1.2 mg daily, or QD, 2 mg twice weekly, or QIW, and 4 mg twice weekly, or QIW with initial follow up of safety, tolerability
and tumor volume by MRI after 16 weeks in order to determine the optimal dose. At the end of Part A, all patients will be eligible to

AL102 for the treatment of other rare indications including T-ALL, an aggressive, rare form of T-cell specific leukemia. T-ALL has
an annual incidence of approximately 1,200 patients in the United States, of which an estimated 400 patients, including pediatric
patients, present for the treatment of relapsed/refractory, or R/R, T-ALL. Approximately 65% of all R/R T-ALL patients have
Notch-activating mutations. In addition, there is an incremental subset of patients with Notch pathway activation who do not bear
Notch-activating mutations. R/R T-ALL is characterized by chemotherapy resistance, induction failure and tendency for early relapse,
as 55% of adult patients and 20% of pediatric patients will relapse following first-line therapy. In the Phase 1 study of AL101,
which included 26 unselected, heavily pretreated evaluable T-ALL subjects treated with 4 mg or 6 mg dose levels, a CR was observed
in two T-ALL subjects and a PR was observed in one T-ALL subject. Of the three T-ALL subjects who displayed a response, two had a
confirmed Notch-activating mutation. Based on these findings and supporting data from our preclinical studies, we intend to commence
a Phase 2 clinical trial of AL102 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL in the second half of 2022, subject to the impact of COVID-19 on
our business.</p><div>

are collaborating with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited, or Novartis, to develop AL102 for the treatment of multiple myeloma,
or MM, in combination with Novartis’ B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, targeting therapies. We granted Novartis the exclusive
ability to evaluate, develop and potentially license and commercialize AL102 exclusively as a monotherapy and in combination with other
therapies for the treatment of MM. Novartis conducted a preclinical study evaluating AL102 alone and in combination with Novartis’
bi-specific antibody. Using a cell line model of human MM, Novartis’ study showed that treatment with AL102 resulted in an approximate
20-fold increase in the levels of cell surface expression of BCMA. Furthermore, using human MM cells from donors, Novartis’ study
showed that AL102 enhanced BCMA-CD3 bi-specific antibody redirected t-cell cytotoxicity activity in vitro. We believe that the clinical
activity of BCMA-targeting agents may also be enhanced in clinical trials when used in combination with a GSI such as AL102.</span> <span>The

a monotherapy in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma, or R/M ACC,
for patients bearing Notch-activating mutations. We refer to this trial as the ACCURACY trial. We use next-generation sequencing, or NGS,
to identify patients with Notch-activating mutations, an approach that we believe will enable us to target the patient population with
cancers that we believe are most likely to respond to and benefit from AL101 treatment. We chose to initially target R/M ACC based on
our differentiated approach, which is comprised of: data generated in a Phase 1 study of AL101 in unselected, heavily pretreated subjects
conducted by BMS, our own data generated in patient-derived xenograft models, our bioinformatics platform and our expertise in the Notch
pathway.</p><div>

glands, most commonly of the salivary glands. It has an annual incidence of approximately 3,400 patients in the United States, approximately
1,700 of whom are R/M ACC patients. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for patients with R/M ACC. Based on scientific literature
and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that 18% to 22% of R/M ACC patients have Notch-activating mutations. These Notch patients
have a significantly worse prognosis, with estimated overall median survival rates roughly four times shorter than patients without Notch-activating
mutations. According to published data from 31 Phase 2 clinical trials in ACC conducted since 2005 using a variety of treatment modalities,
these treatments showed limited or no clinical activity in unselected ACC subjects. The objective response rates, or ORR, in 30 of these
trials, ranged from 0% to 20%, with a 47% ORR observed in one trial conducted in China. In 15 of the 31 trials, a 0% ORR was observed.
ORR includes subjects who displayed either a complete response, or CR, or a partial response, or PR.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">The Notch pathway has long been implicated
in multiple solid tumor and hematological cancers, and often has been associated with more aggressive cancers. Notch receptors serve as
critical facilitators in processes such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and metastatic spread,
which all contribute to a poorer prognosis. Humans have four Notch receptors, known as Notch 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as five transmembrane-bound
ligands. Different forms of cancer are associated with different types of Notch mutations.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">As seen on the left side of the above
graphic, normal Notch receptor signaling is initiated by the binding of a ligand expressed on an adjacent cell, which triggers a conformational
change, permitting cleavage of the Notch receptor by the g-secretase complex. As seen on the right side of the above graphic, this cleavage
releases the Notch intracellular domain, or NICD, which then translocates to the cell nucleus, interacts with transcription complexes
and promotes the transcription of downstream target genes that regulate critical cell functions. This pathway activation is terminated
by the degradation of NICD. Activating mutations in the Notch receptor lead to accumulation of the NICD and hyper-activation of the pathway,
resulting in excess NICD. Hyper-activation of the Notch pathway promotes cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance
and metastatic spread, which are each hallmarks of cancer.</p><div>

step required for Notch activation, thereby “turning off” the aberrant activation of the Notch pathway. We have designed our

the primary therapies for desmoid tumors, there are no treatment options for some patients given the diffuse nature of the tumor in some
tissues. Surgery and radiation suffer from additional shortcomings including the morbidity associated with resection, disfigurement and/or
functional impairment, post-operative complications and frequent recurrences. Aggressive adjuvant radiation therapy and surgical resection
with wide margins of normal tissue may improve rates of post-surgical recurrence, which can occur in up to 72% of patients.</p><div>

therapies for the treatment of unresectable, recurrent or progressive desmoid tumors and there is no currently accepted standard of care.
Since current treatment responses are insufficient and not durable, there is an unmet medical need for the treatment of recurrent or progressive

is a sizeable patient population with desmoid tumors with a high unmet medical need.</p><div>

Both patients achieved long-lasting PRs with AL101 treatment with a maximum decrease in tumor size from baseline of
41% after approximately 1 year (55 weeks) of treatment in Case One, and a maximum decrease in tumor size from baseline of 60% after about
1.6 years (82 weeks) of treatment in Case Two. With continued monitoring, one patient was able to discontinue AL101 after 4.6 years of

RINGSIDE pivotal study, which could potentially be used as a registrational trial, in adult and adolescent patients with desmoid tumors.
The study’s primary endpoint is progression free survival with secondary endpoints including, objective response rate, duration
of response and patient reported Quality of Life measures. Part A of the study completed enrollment of 42 patients with progressive desmoid
tumors in three study arms across three doses of AL102: 1.2 mg daily, 2 mg twice weekly, and 4 mg twice weekly with initial follow up
to evaluate safety, tolerability and tumor volume by MRI after 16 weeks in order to determine the optimal dose. At the end of Part A, all patients
will be eligible to enroll into an open label extension study at the selected dose where long-term efficacy and safety will be monitored.
Part B of the study will start immediately after dose selection from Part A and will be a double-blind placebo-controlled study enrolling
up to 156 patients with progressive disease, randomized between AL102 or placebo. We expect to report initial interim data read-out from
Part A and dose selection around mid-2022, with Part B of the study to commence immediately thereafter.</p><div>

the exclusive ability to evaluate, develop and potentially license and commercialize AL102, as a monotherapy and in combination with other
therapies, for the treatment of MM. Novartis conducted a preclinical study evaluating AL102 alone and in combination with an investigational
anti-BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, or BisAb, controlled by Novartis. Using a preclinical cell line model of human multiple myeloma (KMS11)
and shown in the figure below, Novartis’ study showed that treatment with AL102 resulted in an approximate 20-fold increase in the
levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and decreased shedding of BCMA to below lower levels of detection, as measured by levels of

leukemia, a disease which has an annual incidence of approximately 6,000 patients in the United States. T-ALL has an annual incidence
of approximately 1,200 patients in the United States, of which an estimated 400, including pediatric patients, present for the treatment
of R/R T-ALL. Notch is known to be a critical component of T-cell development and is inherently implicated as a tumorigenic driver in
T-ALL. Approximately 65% of all T-ALL patients have Notch-activating mutations. In addition, there is an incremental subset of patients
with Notch pathway activation who do not bear Notch-activating mutations.</p><div>

being unable to produce sufficient amounts of normal blood cells, leading to symptoms such as anemia, infection, bleeding, bruising, fever,
weakness and fatigue. Patients suffering from T-ALL frequently have central nervous system complications, as well as swollen lymph nodes

transplant. However, in order to be eligible to receive a transplant, patients must have exhibited a CR to prior therapies. The current
standard first-line therapy for T-ALL is an intensive chemotherapy regimen, which yields overall survival rates greater than 80% among
pediatric patients and approximately 50% among adult patients. Although first-line therapy is effective in most T-ALL patients, an estimated
55% of adult patients and 20% of pediatric patients will relapse. Second-line therapies for R/R T-ALL include targeted therapies administered
in combination with chemotherapy and have shown limited efficacy, with an overall survival rate lower than 20% for pediatric patients.
As a result, we believe that there remains a lack of effective treatment options for patients with R/R T-ALL.</p><div>

of secretory glands including the salivary glands. While major salivary glands are located in the mouth, minor salivary glands are scattered
throughout the aerodigestive tract and are mostly concentrated in cheeks, lips, tongue, palate and floor of the mouth. ACC can also arise
in other sites outside the head and neck. When presenting in the major salivary glands, ACC can cause symptoms of varying severity, including
numbness, difficulty swallowing or paralysis of a facial nerve.</p><div>

rate and, along with its persistent and relentless progressive course, often manifests as local recurrences and late-onset distant metastasis.
ACC has an annual incidence of approximately 3,400 patients in the United States, approximately 1,700 of which are R/M ACC patients. Based
on primary literature and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that 18% to 22% of R/M ACC patients have Notch-activating mutations.</p><div>

of cancer and ACC specifically evolved, the importance of the Notch pathway and Notch-activating mutations was established. A recent publication
from MD Anderson Cancer Center examined the relationship between Notch-activating mutations and ACC patient prognosis in 102 subjects,
as illustrated in the figures above. The figure on the left shows that the relapse free survival, or time from diagnosis to relapse, was
reduced from 33.9 months for Notch 1 wild-type, or WT, patients to 12.5 months for Notch 1 mutant patients. In addition, patients with
Notch-activating mutations were more likely to present with advanced-stage disease and they developed a somewhat different pattern of
metastatic disease compared to Notch 1 WT patients. Similarly, the graphic on the right demonstrates that median overall survival was
reduced from 121.9 months for Notch 1 WT patients to 29.6 months for Notch 1 mutant patients. Similar results were subsequently observed
in an additional retrospective study analyzing data from 84 ACC subjects at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where median overall
survival was reduced from 204.5 months for Notch 1 WT patients to 55.1 months for Notch 1 mutant patients.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">The current standard of care is typically
surgery followed by radiation. Radiation or systemic therapy, comprised of chemotherapy and targeted drugs, may be recommended if the
tumor cannot be surgically removed or in cases of advanced metastatic disease. There are limited systemic therapy treatment options, and
no FDA-approved therapies, available for patients with R/M ACC. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, or SEER,
the relative survival rate for all ACC patients in the United States between 1975 and 2016 was 81% at five years and 66% at ten years.
Treatment has been particularly ineffective for ACC patients with metastatic disease, where survival rates are much lower: 33% at five
years and 24% at ten years. According to published data from 31 Phase 2 clinical trials in ACC conducted since 2005 using a variety of
treatment modalities, these treatments showed limited or no clinical activity in unselected ACC subjects. The ORR in 30 of these trials
ranged from 0% to 20%, with a 47% ORR observed in one trial conducted in China. In 15 of the 31 trials, a 0% ORR was observed. Accordingly,
there remains a lack of effective treatment options for patients with R/M ACC.</p><div>

was generally observed to be well tolerated in the interim data as of July 30, 2020, with most adverse events being mild to moderate
in severity. All subjects experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event, or TRAE, while approximately 20% experienced a
Grade 3 or 4 TRAE. In addition, seven subjects experienced a total of eight treatment-related serious adverse events, or TRSAEs. The
eight TRSAEs included two Grade 2 infusion reactions, one Grade 1 keratoacanthoma, one Grade 3 aspartate aminnotransferase increase,
one Grade 3 pneumonia, one Grade 3 decreased appetite, one Grade 3 transient ischemic attack (TIA) and one Grade 4 hyponatremia.
Eight subjects had a dose reduction from 4 mg to 2.4 mg, six of which were within two weeks of an adverse event. There were 17 dose
interruptions resulting in delays of at least one week due to adverse events, most of which were no more than two weeks in length.
Five subjects began treatment but discontinued before their first post-dose radiographic evaluation. Of these five subjects, one
subject discontinued due to an infusion reaction, one due to pneumonia, two subjects discontinued due to non-treatment related
adverse events and one subject stopped treatment without a first follow-up radiographic evaluation. Therefore, these five subjects
were considered non-evaluable for efficacy. There were four deaths within 30 days of stopping AL101 treatment, which were assessed
by the investigator not to be treatment-related. One additional death was reported for a subject who was not evaluated for efficacy.
This death was assessed by the investigator to likely be treatment-related, though assessed by the trial sponsor to likely be the
result of advanced disease and/or pneumonia. The following chart depicts the TRAEs observed in our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial, as of the
data cutoff date of June 30, 2020.</p><div>

Of these subjects, 43 were treated with 4 mg of AL101 IV once weekly and 14 subjects were treated with 6 mg of AL101 IV once weekly.
An additional 11 subjects were treated in a twice-weekly dosing arm and received either 4 mg or 6 mg of AL101 IV twice weekly. The primary
objective of the CA216001 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL101. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK,
pharmacodynamics, or PD, changes in the expression of Notch-induced genes and the anti-tumor activity of AL101. Formal statistical testing
for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics. The design of this study, including dose

subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, which we refer to as the CA216003 study, AL101 IV was administered in combination with
three different chemotherapy regimens. A total of 95 subjects were evaluated in the study, with 90 subjects receiving both chemotherapy
and AL101. The primary objective of the CA216003 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy.
Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy, PD changes in the expression of Notch-induced
genes after treatment with AL101 in combination with chemotherapy and the anti-tumor activity of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy.
Formal statistical testing for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics.</p><div>

by the investigator or BMS to be treatment-related. Treatment was discontinued in 15 subjects due to TRAEs. Nearly all subjects experienced
at least one TRAE and approximately 82% of subjects experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 TRAE. In addition, approximately 34% of subjects
experienced TRSAEs. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TRSAEs included febrile neutropenia (10%) and diarrhea (6%). The most commonly
reported TRAEs included: fatigue (78%), diarrhea (63%), hypophosphatemia (62%), nausea (52%), decreased appetite (46%), vomiting (39%),

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The term of individual patents depends
upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file patent applications, including
the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application, assuming
the patent has not been terminally disclaimed over a commonly-owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor, or over a patent not
commonly owned but that was disqualified as prior art as the result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement.
In the United States, the term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term adjustment for delays within the United States Patent
and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration
Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, may permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While
the length of such patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot
extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per approved drug
may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be
extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers
an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents
covering those products. We plan to seek any available patent term extension to any issued patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction
where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in
the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.</p><div>

trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the
FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational
plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and <i>in vitro</i> studies assessing the toxicology,
pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information;
and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human
clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day
time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical
hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission
of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.</p><div>

the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance
with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any
clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the
parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND
must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the
last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must
be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies
suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk
to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increased rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that
listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.</p><div>

trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that
site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any
time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is
unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized
by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may
move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it
determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are
also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.</p><div>

sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end
of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the
sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach
consensus on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical
results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.</p><div>

usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics
of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing
process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must
develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected
and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration
over its shelf life.</p><div>

required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other
non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry
of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market
the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under
certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product
also includes a non-orphan indication. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before
accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional
information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted
application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether
a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s
identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the
FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the
submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two
months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.</p><div>

will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing
information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the
application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA
identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical or other significant and time-consuming
requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must
resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information
are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.</p><div>

is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product
may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits
of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine
and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician
communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization
tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls
and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is
not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market
studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit
further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.</p><div>

Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication,
new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric
assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric
subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for
some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready
for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be
collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the
required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.</p><div>

may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer
than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable
expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition
will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan
designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation
does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.</p><div>

orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the
product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the
same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical
superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation
of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax
advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the
orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product
has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of a competing product candidate for seven years if a competitor
obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if such product candidate is determined to be contained within the
competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing
approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.</p><div>

of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation
program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically,
drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and
demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the
combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product
candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once
an NDA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product candidate, the
FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor
provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that
the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">A product candidate intended to treat a serious
or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review.
A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate,
alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on
one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation
includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1

eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated
approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide  a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared
to available products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a product
candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with
priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs
under its current PDUFA review goals.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, a product candidate may
be eligible for accelerated approval. Product candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible
for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely
to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is
reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity,
rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA will
generally require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical
trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving
accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies
or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional
materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.</p><div>

to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion
of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject
to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their
subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced
inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements
upon NDA sponsors and any third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the
significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction
of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with
cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.</p><div>

under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent
marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is
a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule
or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review
an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company
for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative
drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one
of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">The FDCA alternatively provides three
years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability
studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for
example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which
the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2)
NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will
not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain
a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.</p><div>

of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity
attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the

exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.</p><div>

candidates may require an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our product candidates. These diagnostics,
often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations,
and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and
clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion,
sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing
clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to
a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any
companion diagnostic developed for our product candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.</p><div>

to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously
with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and
approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel product candidates, a companion
diagnostic device and its corresponding drug candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in
the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical
trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device
is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally
will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor
of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a
drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study,
if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details
of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.</p><div>

diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously
with approval of the therapeutic. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and
review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and
provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components
regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include
the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the
device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the
diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As
part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation,
or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.</p><div>

application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which
usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling,
or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes
that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those
originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety
and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.</p><div>

PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable
letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable.
The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months
or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn
by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems
are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with
a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be
expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.</p><div>

it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which
they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device
manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR,
which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging
and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections

in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the
EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member
states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision
processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.</p><div>

separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and
an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the
submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent
authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other
things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and
quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint
assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related
to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU
portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.</p><div>

for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, reference products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two
years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical
and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during
a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents
a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA
of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during
the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during
the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity,

terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market
and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to
negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, and
became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition
of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual
recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.</p><div>

will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in
favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal
products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow
flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.</p><div>

on May 26, 2022. However on October 14, 2021, the European Commission proposed a “progressive” roll-out of the IVDR to prevent
disruption in the supply of IVD MDs. The European Parliament and Council voted to adopt the proposed regulation on December 15, 2021 and
the regulation entered into force on January 2022. The IVDR will fully apply on May 26, 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending
the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation.</p><div>

for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific
medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a
conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from
the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within
the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the
centralized procedure, or a MAA for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances,
the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authorities or the EMA.</p><div>

to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions
in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">For example, the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving
remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering
or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal
healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order
to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation
of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil
monetary penalties statute. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other
things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government
or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal
government. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal
statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar
to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent
to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs,
devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians,
certain other healthcare professionals, teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations as well as
ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additional reporting and transparency requirements
for payments to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology
assistants and certified nurse midwives go into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend,
in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare
programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent
of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover
a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination
process can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can
be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the
first instance.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, third-party payors are increasingly
reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing
cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic
products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost
effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment
measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of
any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could
reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">In international markets, reimbursement
and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and
therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which
their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member
state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability
of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in
foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore,
there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered
cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that
the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.</p><div>

and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory
changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is
financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those
governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA
increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average
manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible
annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified
federal government programs; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such
research; and established a Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery
models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.</p><div>

have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June&nbsp;17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court
dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the
Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February&nbsp;15,
2021 through August&nbsp;15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order
also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules&nbsp;that limit access to healthcare.</p><div>

changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers
of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with
the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June
30, 2022, absent additional congressional action. More recently, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan
Act of&nbsp;2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average

and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas,
including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific
consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising
technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for

the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $111.1 million. As noted below, we have identified conditions and events that raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We
have not commercialized any products and have never generated revenue from the commercialization of any product. To date, we have devoted
most of our financial resources to licensing product candidates and research and development, including our preclinical development activities
and clinical trials.</p><div>

expenses and increasing net losses for the next several years, at least, as we advance AL101, AL102 and any future product candidate through
preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approvals and commercialize AL101, AL102 or any other product candidate, if approved.
The costs of advancing product candidates into each clinical phase tend to increase substantially over the duration of the clinical development
process. Therefore, the total costs to advance any of our product candidates to marketing approval in even a single jurisdiction will
be substantial. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately
predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to begin generating revenue from the commercialization
of any products or achieve or maintain profitability. Our expenses will also increase substantially if and as we:</p><div>

uncertainties, as described under “—Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing, Manufacturing and Regulatory Approval”

flows for the foreseeable future. These net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our
stockholders’ equity and working capital. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth
of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. If we are unable to develop and commercialize one or more product candidates, either
alone or through collaborations, or if revenues from any product that receives marketing approval are insufficient, we will not achieve
profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain profitability or meet outside expectations for our profitability.

we believe we will not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations within the next twelve months from the issuance of our audited consolidated

There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise
additional capital through future equity offerings, the ownership interest of common stockholders will be diluted, which dilution may
be significant. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any or sufficient additional funding or that such funding,
if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. In the event that we are unable to obtain any or sufficient additional funding,

toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients may not be willing and/or able to comply with clinical trial protocols due to the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and
retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 may
be impeded, which would adversely impact our clinical trial operations. The diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of
clinical trials to focus on pandemic concerns, including the attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators and hospitals
serving as our clinical trial sites, diversion of hospitals and medical centers or sites serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital
or other staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials may significantly disrupt our research activities. As a result, the expected
timeline for data readouts of our clinical trials and certain regulatory filings will likely be negatively impacted, which would adversely

adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><div>

response to the COVID-19 pandemic may redirect resources with respect to regulatory matters and intellectual property matters in a
way that would adversely impact our ability to progress regulatory approvals and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we
may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions. For example, in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign
manufacturing facilities, and on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic
manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, in July 2020, the FDA resumed certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing
facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA utilized this risk-based assessment system to assist in
determining when and where it was safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. Additionally, on April 15, 2021, the FDA
issued a guidance document in which the FDA described its plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug
manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites, among other facilities. According to the guidance, the FDA may request such
remote interactive evaluations where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would be appropriate based on mission needs and
travel limitations. In May 2021, the FDA outlined a detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of inspectional operations,
and in July 2021, the FDA resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities and was continuing to maintain this level
of operation as of September 2021. More recently, the FDA has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional
activities to ensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates as it adapts to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
Regulatory authorities outside the United States have adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.  If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to hinder or prevent the
FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could
significantly impact the ability of the FDAor other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business.</p><div>

rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments,
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread, trajectory, and duration of
the pandemic, including due to the emergence of variants; travel restrictions in the United States Canada, Europe, Israel and other regions;
business closures or business disruptions; the effectiveness of vaccines, vaccine distribution efforts, and other treatments; and the
effectiveness of other actions taken in the United States, Canada, Europe, Israel and other regions to contain the pandemic. As a result,
the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and
heighten many of our known risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.</p><div>

in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to expiration. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations
on its ability to use its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. If the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service challenges our determinations with respect to the existence of previous ownership changes or the effects thereof, our ability
to use our NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control,
could also result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December
31, 2020, utilization of federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are limited to a maximum of 80% of the
taxable income for such year, after taking into account utilization of NOLs generated in years beginning before January 1, 2018 and determined
without regard to such NOL deduction. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject
to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs, even if we attain profitability.</p><div>

not completely defined but are substantially smaller than the general treated cancer population, and we will need to screen and identify
these patients. Successful identification of patients is dependent on several factors, including achieving certainty as to how specific
genetic alterations respond to our product candidates and developing companion diagnostics to identify such genetic alterations. Furthermore,
even if we are successful in identifying patients, we cannot be certain that the resulting patient populations will be large enough to
allow us to successfully conduct clinical trials, and if approved, commercialize our products and achieve profitability. Therefore, we
do not know if our approach of treating patients with genetically defined cancers will be successful, and if our approach is unsuccessful,

authorities’ policies with respect to clinical trials may change and additional government regulations may be enacted. For instance,
the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted
in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive
required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority
and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application
to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee
in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well,
including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements
related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized
EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent
to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical
Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years.
Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and,
if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become
subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our third-party service providers, such as CROs,
may impact our developments plans</p><div>

seek to align its regulations with the EU. The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation
(as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). On January 17, 2022, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency, or MHRA, launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March
14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk
proportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched
and will determine whether the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision
by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the EU may have an effect on the cost of
conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization in the EU for
our product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.</p><div>

by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials
and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies,
regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s
clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application.
Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that
our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other data. Even if we eventually complete clinical
testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for our product candidates, the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities
may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested. We have
not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that we will never obtain regulatory approval for AL101,
AL102 or any other product candidate. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive
regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval
from foreign regulatory authorities.</p><div>

increase the uncertainty of, and adversely impact, our clinical trial outcomes. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct

interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by
the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled
patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial
condition and prospects significantly. Patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials may in the future suffer other serious adverse
events or other side effects not observed in our preclinical studies or previous clinical trials. In addition, if our product candidates
are used in combination with other therapies, our product candidates may exacerbate adverse events associated with the therapy and the
severity and frequency of adverse events may be greater than the cumulative severity and frequency of such adverse events when the therapies
are used as monotherapies. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and chemotherapy treatments,
which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidates, but may still impact the success of our clinical
trials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to other
therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients’ illnesses.</p><div>

locus, such as point mutations, insertions, deletions and copy number variations. These tests are able to detect only a subset of the
patients with Notch-activating mutations. To identify additional patients with Notch-activating mutations who we believe may benefit from
the use of our product candidates, we intend to collaborate with leading diagnostics companies to improve the testing capabilities for

200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales
in the United States. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for
grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has Orphan Drug Designation
subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug
exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA to market the same product for the
same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan
drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. However, Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens
the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.</p><div>

if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for any product candidate in specific indications, we may not be the first to obtain marketing

for a disease or condition broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request
for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the
needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.</p><div>

even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the
product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same disease or condition.
Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same
disease or condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient
care. Further, the composition of matter patents for AL101 and AL102 will expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively, and if orphan drug
exclusivity does not protect these products from competition, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely

approval for one or more of our product candidates. Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to
a product candidate designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over available
therapies upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that
is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically
meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a
surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought
to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint
that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible
morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new
drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public
health perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is usually contingent on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent
manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verity and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. If such post-approval
studies fail to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug on an expedited basis.</p><div>

and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors
are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as AL101 and AL102, if approved. Our ability to achieve
acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for products by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations
will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize AL101, AL102 and any other product candidates we develop. Assuming we
obtain coverage for our product candidates by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may
require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States or elsewhere
will be available for our product candidates or any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be
decreased or eliminated in the future.</p><div>

prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement
for particular drugs or biologics when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar, or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible
that a third-party payor may consider our product candidates as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive
product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our product candidates, pricing of existing
drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidates. Increasingly, other third-party payors are requiring
that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult
because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product
or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on
our investment in our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able
to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our product candidates.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in">There is significant uncertainty related
to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and
governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and
biologics will be covered. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models in the United States for how private payors
and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may require
pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such
therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement
for our product candidates.</p><div>

reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can
differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process
that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no
assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules
and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and
regulations are likely.</p><div>

operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing
emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries have and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage
of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of
the national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company
profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge
for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced
compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.</p><div>

and third-party payors in the United States to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and
the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product
candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed
healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on
healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and other treatments, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high
barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.</p><div>

manufacture of our product candidates. As a result, we are subject to the risk that our product candidates may have manufacturing
defects that we have limited ability to prevent. CMOs may also have competing obligations that prevent them from manufacturing our

obtained within a reasonable time frame, at an acceptable cost, or at all. In addition, a disruption in the supply of raw materials could
delay the commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved, or result in a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability
to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates. Growth in the costs and expenses of raw materials may also impair our ability

there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June&nbsp;17, 2021, the
U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of
the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment
period from February&nbsp;15, 2021 through August&nbsp;15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA
marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and
rules&nbsp;that limit access to healthcare.</p><div>

changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011,
resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April
2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a
temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, unless
additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among
other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer
treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from
three to five years. More recently, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of&nbsp;2021 into law,
which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer
price,&nbsp;beginning January 1, 2024.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Additionally, the orphan drug tax credit
was reduced as part of a broader tax reform. Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew
Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework
for certain patients to request access to certain IND products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation
for FDA approval. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as
a result of the Right to Try Act. These new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions
in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Moreover, payment methodologies may
be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models,
such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers
set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state
legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government
payor programs, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. We expect that additional U.S. federal
healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay
for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Individual states in the United States
have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological
product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing
cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding
procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare
programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates or put pressure on our product pricing.</p><div>

and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing
pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional
requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and
operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than
EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare
and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member
states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with
ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing
approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our product
candidates, if approved.</p><div>

to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis
for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period
and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas,
including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific
consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising
technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for
assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.</p><div>

adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, which govern the privacy, processing and protection of health-related
and other personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental
authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For
example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual
privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal
information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is
expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and many similar
laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, recently
passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional
consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of
sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could
result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1,
2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in
Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent
privacy legislation in the United States. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other
domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely
affect our financial condition.</p><div>

into research collaborations in the EEA, we may be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which imposes strict requirements
for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. If our or our partners’ or service providers’ privacy or
data security measures fail to comply with GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement
notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to €20 million or 4% of our total worldwide annual
turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as compensation claims by affected individuals, negative publicity,
reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data
subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United
States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the
EU/EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposing further restrictions
on the use of standard contractual clauses, or SCCs. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision
of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers
from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022.
The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the UK; the UK’s Information Commissioner’s
Office launched a public consultation on its draft revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021 and laid its proposal before Parliament,
with the UK SCCs expected to come into force in March 2022, with a two-year grace period. There is some uncertainty around whether the
revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA
entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances
where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory
investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which
we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems
and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.</p><div>

companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, or the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act
2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20
million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of
data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to
longer term, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. The European Commission has adopted an
adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without
additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire
in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that decision.</p><div>

our proprietary position by filing or collaborating with our licensors to file patent applications in the United States and abroad related
to our development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we and
our collaborators may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain or enforce all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable
cost or in a timely manner. Moreover, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly

we enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, CROs, contractors, manufacturers, advisors and other third parties
who have access to our confidential information, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent
application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific
literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States, EU and elsewhere are published approximately
18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we
were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or any licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the
first to file for patent protection of such inventions. The patent applications that we own, or in-license, may fail to result in issued
patents with claims that provide further coverage of AL101, AL102 or any other product candidate or methods of use thereof in the United
States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and
patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application.
Additionally, any U.S. provisional patent application that we or our licensors file is not eligible to become an issued patent until,
among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application.
If we or our licensors do not timely file any non-provisional patent application, we may lose our priority date with respect to the provisional
patent application and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in the provisional patent application. Even if patents do successfully
issue and even if such patents further cover AL101, AL102 or any future product candidate or methods of use thereof, third parties may
challenge their validity, ownership, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, circumvented,

necessary for the successful commercialization of AL101, AL102 or the methods of use thereof, or any other product candidates that we
may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate

same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of
the human body more than United States law does. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United
States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions or obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property

prior art, or our owned and licensed patents may be challenged, in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such
challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable,
in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products,
or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Thus, even if our patent applications issue as patents,
they may not issue in a form that will provide us with meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise
provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of
a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Patent term extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection
it affords, is limited. Without sufficient patent protection for our current or future product candidates, we may be open to competition
from generic versions of such products. Our competitors or other third parties may also be able to circumvent our patents by developing
similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.</p><div>

interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including
our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such

reexamination and derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices.
The various markets in which we plan to operate are subject to frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual
property rights, and third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted
in the future, regardless of their merit. In addition, many companies in intellectual property-dependent industries, including the biotechnology

Numerous U.S., EU and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in
which we are developing product candidates, and as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued,
the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the intellectual
property rights of third parties. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs
of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding

be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents,

harm our business significantly. We might also be forced to redesign or modify our product candidates so that we no longer infringe the
third-party intellectual property rights, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign or modification could
be impossible or technically infeasible. Even if we were ultimately to prevail, any of these events could require us to divert substantial
financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. In addition, if the breadth or strength
of protection provided the patents and patent applications we own or in-license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating
with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.</p><div>

were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce an owned or in-licensed patent covering one of our product candidates,
the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States and in Europe,
defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace, and a court may decide that a patent owned or in-licensed
by us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our owned
and in-licensed patents do not cover the technology in question. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet
any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Third parties might allege unenforceability
of our patents because during prosecution of the patent an individual connected with such prosecution withheld relevant information, or
made a misleading statement. The outcome of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation
is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of
which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution, but that an adverse third party may identify and submit in support of
such assertions of invalidity. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at
least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Our patents and other intellectual property rights also
will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without infringing our patents or other intellectual
property rights.</p><div>

in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by
disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim
proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors view these announcements in a negative light, the price of our common
stock could be adversely affected. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources
available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or
proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because
of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation

patents in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries involve both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and
enforcing biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the Leahy-Smith
America Invents Act, or the AIA, which was passed in September 2011, resulted in significant changes to the U.S. patent system.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0in; text-indent: 0.5in">An important change introduced by the
AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned from a “first-to-invent” to a “first-to-file”
system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming
the same invention. Under a “first-to-file” system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor
to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the
invention earlier. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded
a patent covering an invention of ours even if we made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be
cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application and be diligent in filing patent applications, but circumstances
could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.</p><div>

by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to
challenge any issued patent with the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because
of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate
a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid
even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action.</p><div>

has ruled on several patent cases in recent years either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or
weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain
patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity, enforceability and value of patents,
once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, as well as similar bodies in other jurisdictions,
the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to
enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent
laws have also increased in recent years. In addition, the European patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that
are allowed during prosecution. Complying with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future
that may be important for our business, and these laws and regulations patents could continue to change in unpredictable ways that could

in which such noncompliance will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, and the partial or complete loss
of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application
include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and

of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets or other forms
of intellectual property, which could make it difficult for us to prevent competitors in some jurisdictions from marketing competing products
in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful,
are likely to result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and additionally could
put at risk our or our licensors’ patents of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could increase the risk of our or our licensors’
patent applications not issuing, or could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we

that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates.
Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect
on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we or our licensors

FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension
under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term
extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during
product development and the FDA regulatory review process. While the length of such patent term extension is related to the length
of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14
years from the date of product approval, only one patent per approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the
approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. In the EU, our product candidates may

extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, fail to exercise
due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Even if we
are granted such extension, the duration of such extension may be less than our request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term
extension, or if the term of any such extension is less than our request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights
for that product will be in effect shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. The

are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets and confidential know-how used by our licensors,
collaborators and suppliers. Because we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture AL101, AL102 and any future product candidates,
and we expect to collaborate with third parties on the development of AL101, AL102 and any future product candidates, we must, at times,
share trade secrets with them. We also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under
the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Under such circumstances, trade secrets or confidential
know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential.</p><div>

against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants, CROs, contractors,
manufacturers, advisors and other third parties who have access to our confidential information to enter into confidentiality
agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with us prior to
beginning research or us disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use
or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such
agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology. Despite our efforts, any
such parties may breach these agreements and unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and
confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
The need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our
competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these
agreements. Given that our competitive position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery
of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have an adverse effect on
our business and results of operations. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally or misappropriated trade secrets or
confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable, and the enforceability of confidentiality agreements and the
protection of trade secrets generally may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p><div>

in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional intellectual property or proprietary rights. For example, our programs may
involve product candidates that may require the use of additional intellectual property or proprietary rights held by third parties. Our
product candidates may also require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently, which may be covered by intellectual property
rights held by others. We may also develop products containing combinations of our compositions and pre-existing pharmaceutical compositions,
and could be required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to provide a companion diagnostic test or tests with our
product candidates, both of which may also be covered by intellectual property rights held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license
any relevant third-party intellectual property rights that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations at a reasonable
cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area,
and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may
consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources
and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be
unwilling to assign or license rights to us. In cases where we are unable to procure sufficient rights to third-party intellectual property
rights, we might need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights and/or develop
alternative approaches that do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate such intellectual property rights. This could entail
additional costs and development delays, and the development of such alternatives may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a
license under such intellectual property rights, any such license may be non-exclusive, which may allow our competitors access to the
same technologies licensed to us. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from developing or commercializing one or more of our product
candidates, or force us to modify such product candidates, or to cease some aspect of our business operations, which could have a material

place. In addition, there are concerns that Iran, which has previously threatened to attack Israel, may step up its efforts to achieve
nuclear capability. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah
in Lebanon, as well as a growing presence in Syria. Additionally, the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, or ISIL, a violent jihadist group
whose stated purpose is to take control of the Middle East, remains active in areas within close proximity to Israeli borders. The tension
between Israel and Iran and/or these groups may escalate in the future and turn violent, which could affect the Israeli economy in general
and us in particular. Any potential future conflict could also include missile strikes against parts of Israel, including our offices
and facilities. Such instability may lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel
and certain other countries. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business
conditions, could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business
may be disinclined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when
necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result
in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments
under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.</p><div>

compensate us fully for damages incurred and the government may cease providing such coverage or the coverage might not suffice to cover
potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts, political
instability, terrorism, cyberattacks or any other hostilities involving or threatening Israel would likely negatively affect business

agreements with our employees pursuant to which such individuals agree to assign to us all rights to any inventions created during their

of their employment with us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 1967, or the Patent Law, inventions conceived by an employee during the scope
of his or her employment with a company and as a result thereof are regarded as “service inventions,” which belong to the
employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also
provides that if there is no agreement between an employer and an employee with respect to the employee’s right to receive compensation
for such “service inventions,” the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee, a body constituted under
the Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her service inventions and the scope and conditions
for such remuneration. The Committee will examine, on a case-by-case basis, the general contractual framework between the parties, using
interpretation rules of the general Israeli contract laws. Further, the Committee has not yet determined one specific formula for calculating
this remuneration (but rather uses the criteria specified in the Patent Law). Although our employees have agreed to assign to us service
invention rights, as a result of uncertainty under Israeli law with respect to the efficacy of waivers of service invention rights, we
may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned inventions. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required
to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current and/or former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could

need to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard,
we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, adopt a detailed work plan to
assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as
appropriate, validate through testing whether such controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and
improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that in certain periods we
will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed time frame or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is
effective as required by Section 404. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse

focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics for patients suffering from rare and aggressive cancers, primarily
in genetically defined patient populations. Our differentiated development approach is predicated on identifying and addressing tumorigenic
drivers of cancer, through a combination of our bioinformatics platform and next-generation sequencing to deliver targeted therapies to
underserved patient populations. Our current portfolio of product candidates, AL101 and AL102, targets the aberrant activation of the
Notch pathway using gamma secretase inhibitors. Gamma secretase is the enzyme responsible for Notch activation and, when inhibited, turns
off the Notch pathway activation. Aberrant activation of the Notch pathway has long been implicated in multiple solid tumor and hematological
cancers and has often been associated with more aggressive cancers. In cancers, Notch is known to serve as a critical facilitator in processes
such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and metastatic spread, all of which contribute to a poorer
patient prognosis. AL101 and AL102 are designed to address the underlying key drivers of tumor growth, and our initial Phase 2 clinical
data of AL101 suggest that our approach may address shortcomings of existing treatment options. We believe that our novel product candidates,
if approved, have the potential to transform treatment outcomes for patients suffering from rare and aggressive cancers.</p><div>

product candidates, AL101 and AL102, are being developed as potent, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitors, or GSIs.
We obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize AL101 and AL102 from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS,
in November 2017. BMS evaluated AL101 in three Phase 1 studies involving more than 200 total subjects and AL102 in a single Phase 1
study involving 36 subjects with various cancers who had not been prospectively characterized for Notch activation, and to whom we refer to
as unselected subjects. While these Phase 1 studies did not report statistically significant overall results, clinical activity was
observed across these studies in cancers in which Notch has been implicated as a tumorigenic driver.</p><div>

thereafter. Part B of the study will be a double-blind placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 156 patients
with progressive disease, randomized between AL102 or placebo. The study’s primary endpoint will be progression free survival, or
PFS with secondary endpoints including ORR, duration of response, or DOR and patient reported QOL measures.</p><div>

with Notch-activating mutations, an approach that we believe will enable us to target the patient population with cancers that we believe
are most likely to respond to and benefit from AL101 treatment. We chose to initially target R/M ACC based on our differentiated approach,
which is comprised of: data generated in a Phase 1 study of AL101 in unselected, heavily pretreated subjects conducted by BMS, our own
data generated in patient-derived xenograft models, our bioinformatics platform and our expertise in the Notch pathway.</p><div>

treatment of R/M ACC. In the second quarter of 2020, we commenced dosing of patients in our ACCURACY trial for the treatment of R/M ACC

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and
analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our
estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may

with the guidelines in the Practice Guide, which prescribes several valuation approaches for setting the value of an enterprise, such
as the cost, income and market approaches, and various methodologies for allocating the value of an enterprise to its common stock. Through
September 2019, we utilized the option pricing method, or OPM, and a guideline transaction method, which we believed was the most appropriate
for each of the valuations of our common stock performed by our independent third-party valuation specialist. The OPM treats our security
classes as call options on total equity value, and allocates our equity value across its security classes based on the rights and preferences
of the securities within the capital structure under an assumed liquidation event. The OPM method is used when the range of possible future
outcomes is difficult to predict and forecasts would be highly speculative. We believed this method was the most appropriate given the
expectation of various potential liquidity outcomes and the difficulty of selecting appropriate enterprise values given our early stage
of development, while allowing us to accurately capture the potential downside risk of our clinical-stage assets. Beginning in November
2019, for options granted after September 30, 2019, we utilized a hybrid of the OPM and Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or
PWERM. The PWERM is a scenario based analysis that estimates the value per share based on the probability-weighted present value of expected
future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to us, as well as the economic and control rights of each
share class. Under this hybrid method, we considered both the initial public offering liquidity scenario and an alternative scenario in
the event an initial public offering does not occur. In October 2019, we engaged a new third-party valuation firm to retrospectively estimate
the value of our common stock as of certain prior dates. Stock-based compensation was awarded as a result of such retrospective valuations.</p><div>

inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common stock. These judgments and estimates are management’s best estimates
and include assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing an initial public offering or other liquidity
event, the related company valuations associated with such events and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods. If we had
made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per common share could have been different.</p><div>

trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data
or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not
achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially
available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.
Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.</p><div>

capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Any debt financing, if available,
may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.</p><div>

changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, and 2021, our cash equivalents consisted of interest-bearing checking accounts. Our
primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
Due to the short-term nature and the low-risk profile of our interest-bearing accounts, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would
not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term restricted bank deposits or on our
financial position or results of operations. We are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates; however, we have contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors located in Europe and Israel. Our operations
may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. Inflation generally affects us by increasing our clinical
trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during
the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2021.</p><div>

standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p><div>

to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p><div>

trial costs are a component of research and development expenses. The Company bases its expenses related to Clinical Research
Organization (“CRO”) on the services received, and efforts expanded pursuant to agreements with them. The financial
terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. In
instances where payments made to CROs exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and
development expenses. For reoccurring services fees, the Company calculates the time period over which services will be performed
and the level of effort to be expanded in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services varies from the
calculation, the Company adjusts the accrual or amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods
and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or
when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.</p><p style="text-indent: 0.5in; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</p></ix:continuation></span></ix:continuation></span><div>

own equity. The guidance also requires entities to use the&nbsp;if-converted&nbsp;method for all convertible instruments in the diluted

for certain liability-classified share-based payment awards. ASU&nbsp;2020-06&nbsp;is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,

35% (top rate) to 21% (flat rate) effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 (ii) a new tax deduction in the amount of
37.5% of “foreign derived intangible income” that effectively reduces the federal corporate tax on certain qualified foreign
derived sales/licenses/leases and service income in excess of a base amount to 13.125% (as compared to the regular corporate income tax
rate of 21%); (iii) stricter limitation on the tax deductibility of business interest expense; (iv) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational
corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S.

ownership change, our ability to use our NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some
