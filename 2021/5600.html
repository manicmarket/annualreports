We plan to achieve this goal by advancing the drug and drug/device combination product candidates in our portfolio through mid- to late-stage clinical development, and potentially regulatory approval, as well as by establishing and leveraging strategic partnerships and other collaborations to complete product development and commercialize our products, if approved. We are also exploring portfolio expansion through both business development activities that may result in acquiring, or acquiring access to, new product candidates through in-licensing or other collaborative arrangements, and leveraging assets we previously acquired or in-licensed from third parties. As with our current portfolio, we look for innovations in women’s health that have (a) attractive market opportunities and potential to address an unmet medical need, including through new formulations, manners of application or delivery methods of well-known drug substances that result in novel, product candidates customized for women, (b) human proof-of-concept clinical data previously generated by third parties and/or potential to utilize the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway, and (c) potential to become a first-in-category or first-line product. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We believe that there is an opportunity to fill the gap that exists in the development of innovations in women’s health between (a) non-profit organizations, small private companies and individual entrepreneurs that discover, innovate and conduct early-stage research and clinical development of product candidates, and (b) pharmaceutical companies that conduct late-stage clinical development and commercialize approved products. We believe that the development activities between these two ends of this spectrum (early pre-clinical and clinical development of product candidates on the one hand and late-stage clinical trials and commercialization of product candidates on the other) are currently underserved. In addition, we believe there are gaps in treatment options in the women's health market and there is an opportunity to provide therapies that address persistent unmet needs.

The data exclusivity period should block the FDA from approving either a subsequent abbreviated NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that relies in whole or in part on our protected clinical data. See also "Government Regulation - U.S. Government Regulation- New Drug Marketing Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act Amendments &amp; GAIN Exclusivity Extension" below.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15-44. Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of certain bacteria naturally found in the vagina. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, vaginal pain, itching or burning, and burning during urination. We entered this therapeutic category because we felt there was a significant unmet need for better treatment. Branded prescription products that received FDA approval before XACIATO for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis have clinical cure rates (based on the Amsel criteria) ranging from 37-68%.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">XACIATO is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to clindamycin or lincomycin.

The most common adverse reactions reported in &gt;2% of patients and at a higher rate in the XACIATO group than in the placebo group in the pivotal DARE-BVFREE trial were vulvovaginal candidiasis and vulvovaginal discomfort. Systemic clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. It should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Other clindamycin vaginal products have been used to treat pregnant women during the second and third trimester. XACIATO has not been studied in pregnant women. However, based on the low systemic absorption of XACIATO following the intravaginal route of administration in nonpregnant women, maternal use is not likely to result in significant fetal exposure to the drug. Similarly, because systemic absorption following intravaginal administration of clindamycin is low, transfer of the drug into breastmilk is likely to be low and adverse effects on the breastfed infant are not expected. The safety and effectiveness of XACIATO have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. XACIATO has not been evaluated in geriatric patients (65 years of age or older) to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. </span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">6</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline">Clinical Data</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The efficacy of XACIATO as a treatment of bacterial vaginosis in females 12 years of age and older was demonstrated in the Phase 3 DARE-BVFREE trial (NCT04370548), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study that randomized 307 patients at 32 centers across the United States.

We designed the PCT clinical trial to assess general safety and effectiveness in preventing progressively motile sperm from reaching the cervical canal following intercourse and acceptability of the product to the patient. The study evaluated 23 women over the course of five menstrual cycles, with each woman assessed over approximately 21 visits. Each woman’s cervical mucus was measured at several points during the study, including a baseline measurement at menstrual cycle 1 that excluded the use of any product. Subsequent cycles and visits included the use of a diaphragm during intercourse (menstrual cycle 2) and Ovaprene (menstrual cycles 3, 4 and 5). The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate changes from baseline in PCT results due to device use, as represented by the proportion of women and cycles with an average of fewer than five progressively motile sperm (PMS) per high power field (HPF) in midcycle cervical mucus collected two to three hours after intercourse with Ovaprene in place.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our PCT clinical trial met its primary endpoint: Ovaprene prevented the requisite number of sperm from reaching the cervix across all women and all cycles evaluated. Specifically, in 100% of women and cycles, an average of less than five PMS per HPF were present in the midcycle cervical mucus collected two to three hours after intercourse with Ovaprene in place. To calculate the average number of PMS, PMS were counted across each of nine HPFs and averaged. Women enrolled in the study who completed at least one Ovaprene PCT (N=26) had a mean of 27.21 PMS/HPF in their baseline cycle when no contraception was used, a mean of 0.22 PMS/HPF in their diaphragm cycle, which was anticipated based on published studies, and a mean of 0.48 PMS/HPF in their Ovaprene PCT cycles, with a median of zero PMS. No serious or severe adverse events were reported or observed.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">PCT clinical trials have been used as a surrogate marker for contraceptive effectiveness.

We are developing Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, an investigational proprietary cream formulation of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and the active ingredient in the male erectile dysfunction drug Viagra®, for topical administration to the vulva and vagina for treatment of FSAD. Today, there are no FDA-approved products that specifically address the symptoms or underlying pathology of FSAD. We plan to leverage the existing data and established safety profile of sildenafil and the Viagra® brand to utilize the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway to obtain marketing approval of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% in the U.S. for the treatment of women suffering from FSAD.

estradiol released from each formulation of DARE-HRT1 evaluated in the study achieved or exceeded the levels that were targeted for hormone therapy. Target levels of estradiol for hormone treatment for either the VMS or vaginal symptoms of menopause were established by reviewing PK levels published for FDA-approved products for both the treatment of VMS as well as the genitourinary symptoms of menopause. Based on the estradiol PK data in the Phase 1 study, the results support further development of DARE-HRT1 as a potentially effective hormone therapy for both VMS and vaginal symptoms associated with menopause. The levels of progesterone released from each version of DARE-HRT1 evaluated in the study met the objectives of releasing progesterone. Progesterone is used in hormone therapy to reduce the impact of estrogen on nontarget sites, such as the endometrium, to prevent estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The study treatment was well tolerated with the most common adverse events consistent with other vaginal products.

Tamoxifen is a well-known and well-characterized selective estrogen receptor modulator, or SERM. Tamoxifen has unique properties that produce different effects in different types of tissues. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist, meaning that it can inhibit estrogen's effect and hence why it may be effective in treating HR+ breast cancer. However, in other tissue, including vaginal tissue, tamoxifen has been reported to exert an estrogen-like response. This has the potential to have a favorable effect on vaginal cytology. VVA is an inflammation of the vaginal epithelium due to the reduction in levels of circulating estrogen, which is characterized by pain during intercourse, vaginal dryness and irritation. Commonly used therapies for VVA are estrogen-based and often contraindicated in HR+ breast cancer patients, or patients with a genetic predisposition or history of familial disease, because of the concern that estrogen use will promote recurrence or occurrence of disease. Due to the prevalence of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of HR+ breast cancer, the prevalence of VVA in post-menopausal breast cancer patients is estimated to be between 42 and 70 percent. We intend to leverage the existing safety and efficacy data for tamoxifen to utilize the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway to obtain marketing approval of DARE-VVA1 in the U.S. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">An exploratory study of vaginal administration of tamoxifen in four healthy postmenopausal women diagnosed with VVA published in </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Clinical and Experimental Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> demonstrated that tamoxifen self-administered intravaginally for three months clinically benefited women with symptoms of VVA without significant systemic absorption of the study drug.

We expect the study will enroll approximately 40 postmenopausal women with VVA, including a cohort of women with a history of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, at approximately three study sites. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of the five treatment groups (approximately 8 participants per group) that will evaluate four dose levels (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) and a placebo. Following a screening visit, DARE-VVA1 will be self-administered intravaginally once a day for the first two weeks, and then twice a week for the following six weeks for a total treatment period of 56 days. In each treatment group, participants will have serial blood sampling for PK analysis and undergo safety evaluations and preliminary assessments of effectiveness. Following the completion of the treatment period, participants will attend a safety follow-up visit. The primary endpoints of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of DARE-VVA1 by vaginal administration and determine the plasma PK of DARE-VVA1 after intravaginal application. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and PD of DARE-VVA1 in terms of the most bothersome symptom and changes in vaginal cytology and pH.

Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of third party patents that is successfully asserted against us or our licensors may require us to pay substantial damages or may limit our or our licensors' ability to rely on such patent protection. Any third party claim successfully alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the patents may also limit our or our licensors' ability to rely on such patent protection. Even if we, or our licensors were to prevail in any such action, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations. Also, if our product candidates or any future products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, there can be no assurance that any patent applications filed by us or our licensors will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or that any patents will provide a competitive advantage or afford protection against competitors with similar technologies.

The three phases are as follows:</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 1. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 1 includes initial clinical trials introducing an investigational new drug into humans and may be conducted in subjects with the target disease or healthy volunteers. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 2. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication or indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of subjects.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 3. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Phase 3 trials are typically large trials performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug candidate has been obtained. They are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product marketing approval. Phase 3 trials usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">in vitro</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product or therapeutic candidate. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, via a clinical hold, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board, or IRB, is responsible for ensuring that human subjects in clinical studies are protected from inappropriate study risks. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the </span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">24</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of “Phase 4” clinical trials. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Marketing Application Submission and FDA Review</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for prescription drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from receipt in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a drug that is not a new molecular entity, and six months from the receipt date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and the sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. As a result, the NDA review process can be very lengthy. Most innovative drug products (other than biological products) obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, commonly referred to as a traditional or "full NDA." In 1984, with passage of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, that established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs based on an innovator or “reference” product, Congress also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which provides a hybrid pathway combining features of a traditional NDA and a generic drug application. Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products; for example, an applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA in which the applicant relies, at least in part, on information from studies made to show whether a drug is safe or effective that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate or reduce the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including nonclinical and clinical studies, </span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">25</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication for which the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has submitted data.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs it receives, whether submitted under Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2), to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of independent experts for a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving the NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements and to assure the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDA also may require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve an NDA without a REMS plan, if required. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities where the drug product or its API will be produced and the clinical trial sites, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or, in some cases, a complete response letter, or CRL, that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the agency. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the CRL may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter to the applicant. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if a drug product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that </span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">26</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">have been commercialized.

These programs include, but are not limited to, fast track designation, QIDP designation, and priority review designation. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than could occur under standard FDA procedures for interacting with and responding to product sponsors during development and regulatory review. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. A drug that is designated as a qualified infectious disease product (“QIDP”) is also eligible for fast track status. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, which directed FDA to implement QIDP designation program. The GAIN Act created incentives for the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections. A therapeutic candidate designated as a QIDP is eligible for fast track designation, and the first marketing application submitted for a specific drug product and indication for which QIDP designation was granted will be granted priority review. A subsequent application from the same sponsor for the same product and indication will receive priority review designation only if it otherwise meets the criteria for priority review. As discussed further below under “New Drug Marketing Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act Amendments &amp; GAIN Exclusivity Extension - Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity,” the GAIN Act also provides the possibility of a five-year exclusivity extension that is added to any other marketing exclusivity for which a QIDP-designated drug qualifies upon FDA approval.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.

Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. In particular, securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for that are now assessed as program fees for certain NDA-approved drugs. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved drug product. Accordingly, both sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance, and to ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements of the FDCA, such as the requirements for making manufacturing changes to an approved NDA.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Accordingly, even after a new drug approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS plan.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, or PDMA, was the first federal law to set minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states and to regulate the distribution of drug samples.

Congress more recently enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which made significant amendments to the FDCA, including by replacing certain provisions from the PDMA pertaining to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs with a more comprehensive statutory scheme. The DSCSA now requires uniform national standards for wholesale distribution and, for the first time, for third-party logistics providers; it also provides for preemption of certain state laws in the areas of licensure and prescription drug traceability. The comprehensive system envisioned by this law is being implemented both by the FDA and those various stakeholders towards the shared goal of building an interoperable electronic system to identify and trace prescription drugs distributed in the United States for enhanced supply chain security. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers (primarily pharmacies) over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">FDA Review and Approval of Medical Devices </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Medical devices also are strictly regulated by the FDA in the United States. Under the FDCA, a medical device is defined as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant,  in vitro  reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component, part or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.” This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA-regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of a medical product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug or biologic. If not, it is generally a medical device.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless and until it has been cleared through the premarket notification, or 510(k), process, or approved by the FDA pursuant to a PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. As electronic and digital medical devices have become increasingly connected to the Internet, hospital networks, and other medical devices to provide features that improve health care and patient accessibility, FDA and other regulatory authorities have recognized that those same features also increase the risk of potential cybersecurity threats. These types of medical devices may be vulnerable to security breaches, potentially impacting the safety and effectiveness of the device, and accordingly device manufacturers are responsible for identifying cybersecurity risks and hazards associated with their products. In recent years, the FDA has increased its scrutiny of this issue as part of the review and marketing authorization process for new medical devices; the agency also monitors reports of cybersecurity risks as part of its post-marketing device surveillance activities. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those low risk devices for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR; facility registration and product listing; reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions; and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Class II devices are moderate risk devices and are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for most Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed in the United States and for which a PMA was not required (i.e., a Class II device). The device to which the sponsor’s device is compared for the purpose of determining substantial equivalence is called a “predicate device.” The FDA’s goal is to make a substantial equivalence determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt of the 510(k) application, but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but such data is typically required if the predicate device relied in part on clinical trial data to obtain clearance. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">29</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Class III devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk to patients, such as life-sustaining or life-supporting devices, devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or, more generally, devices whose safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. All Class III devices must be reviewed and approved by the FDA through the PMA process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical data, nonclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is submitted and the FDA determines the application is sufficiently complete, the agency will accept it for filing and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the accepted application, although review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR. New PMA applications or supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device. PMA (and supplemental PMAs) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Novel medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they ultimately pose to patients and/or users.

In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, an investigator acting on behalf of the company must, among other things, apply for and obtain IRB approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a “significant risk” (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the company sponsoring the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an IDE. An IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of study participants, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent form are approved by a duly-appointed IRB at each clinical trial site.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">FDA’s IDE regulations govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of GCP requirements, which include, among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators.

Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">30</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Post-Marketing Requirements for Medical Devices </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply that in some ways mirror the post-approval requirements for prescription drugs.

The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As with prescription drugs, the failure to comply with applicable device regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">warning letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">recalls, detentions or seizures of products;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">operating restrictions;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">delays in the introduction of products into the market;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">total or partial suspension of production;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">delay or refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new or modified devices;</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%;padding-left:14.5pt">withdrawals of marketing authorization;

Such products often raise regulatory, policy and review management challenges because they integrate constituent parts that are regulated under different types of regulatory requirements and by different FDA Centers, namely, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. Differences in regulatory pathways for each constituent part can impact the regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including preclinical testing, clinical investigation, marketing applications, manufacturing and quality control, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, and post-approval modifications.

A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The PMOA is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. The Lead Center has primary responsibility for the review and regulation of a combination product; however a second Center is often involved in the review process, especially to provide input regarding the “secondary” component(s). In most instances, the Lead Center applies its usual regulatory pathway. For example, a drug-device combination product assigned to CDER will typically be reviewed under an NDA, while a drug-device combination product assigned to CDRH is typically reviewed under through a 510(k), PMA, or </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">De Novo</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> classification request.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Often it is difficult for OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which Center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute, to obtain a binding decision as to which Center will regulate the combination product.

In addition, The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which became law in December 2016 and, among other things, amended provisions of the FDCA, clarified that for drug-device combination products with a device PMOA and an FDA-approved drug constituent part, Hatch-Waxman Act requirements apply. Accordingly, a potential patent dispute regarding the listed drug that is being referenced by the combination product sponsor may delay the marketing authorization of the combination product. Furthermore, the Cures Act amendments applied Hatch-Waxman Act exclusivity provisions (e.g., new chemical entity and new clinical investigation) to the device clearance and approval process for combination products with a device PMOA.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">New Drug Marketing Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act Amendments &amp; GAIN Exclusivity Extension</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Orange Book Listing &amp; Patent Certification</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As noted above, Congress created the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway in 1984 as part of the Hatch-Waxman Act amendments to the FDCA. At the same time, it also established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they cannot include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer must rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Unlike the ANDA pathway, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness of the proposed change(s) being made to a previously approved drug.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in the Orange Book. Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As part of the NDA review and approval process, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent that has claims that cover the applicant’s product or method of therapeutic use. Upon approval of a new drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential follow-on competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA that relies in full or in part on the reference product.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, it is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. Moreover, to the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the NDA-approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If the follow-on applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA/505(b)(2) applicant. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">Non-Patent Exclusivity</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">An ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product have expired. The Hatch-Waxman Act amendments to the FDCA provided a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of data exclusivity if an NDA or NDA supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosage forms, route of administration or combination of ingredients. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; rather, this three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active ingredient.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA; however, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Under the GAIN Act amendments to the FDCA, the FDA may designate a product as a QIDP for a specific use for which it is being studied, upon the written request of a sponsor at any time prior to submission of a marketing application. In order to qualify for designation as a QIDP, the drug product candidate must qualify as an antibiotic or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (i) an antibiotic or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (ii) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms established and maintained by the FDA. In addition to the expedited review benefits that a QIDP-designated drug candidate may be eligible for (described above under “Special FDA Programs to Facilitate and Expedite Development and Review of Certain New Drugs”), such a drug that is approved for the use for which the QIDP designation was granted will receive a five-year extension to any non-patent marketing exclusivity period for which the drug qualified upon approval, such as a five-year NCE exclusivity or three-year new clinical data exclusivity. This so-called GAIN exclusivity extension is not available to a QIDP-designated drug that has previously received the five-year extension period, such as when an applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or new strength for a marketed infectious disease product.  </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Patent Term Extension </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A patent claiming a prescription drug or medical device for which FDA approval is granted may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the FDCA, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met.

Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government.

Sales of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will depend in part on coverage and adequate payment from third-party payors.

A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but they also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Accordingly, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Accordingly, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or granted at all. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of health care. Individual states in the United States have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers, or PBMs, and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry.

The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations.

However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (the suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022), and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was subsequently signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extends the CARES Act suspension period to March 31, 2021.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Biden Administration, which assumed control of the Executive Branch on January 20, 2021, has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority. For example, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on a Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation that was finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on HHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by HHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing HHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">It is uncertain whether and how future legislation or regulatory changes could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions federal, state, or commercial payors for pharmaceutical products may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation.

The CCPA mirrors a number of the key provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, described below. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will modify the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply and additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Other states in the U.S. are considering privacy laws similar to CCPA. In February 2021, the Virginia legislature became the second to enact a state-specific law called the Consumer Data Protection Act, which includes key differences from California’s law, further complicating compliance by industry and other stakeholders.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Health Care Reform and Potential Changes to Laws and Regulations</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">FDA and other regulatory authority policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act enacted in December 2016. Furthermore, the next FDA Reauthorization Act is currently being negotiated and is due to be submitted to Congress in 2022. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. In addition to the sweeping reforms contained in the ACA (summarized above in the section entitled “Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement”), other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States that may affect health care expenditures. For example, the 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-94) included a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, or the CREATES Act. The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS program for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Other new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our approved product and, accordingly, our financial operations. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services. Moreover, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our therapeutic candidates may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">39</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline">Government Regulation Outside the U.S.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved, either directly or through our distribution partners. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above, and the time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S., which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. To obtain regulatory approval of a therapeutic product candidate under European Union, or EU, regulatory systems, we would be required to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application, which is similar to the NDA, except that, among other things, there are country-specific document requirements. For countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, and recently the United Kingdom, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Moreover, some nations may not accept clinical studies performed for U.S. approval to support approval in their countries or require that additional studies be performed on natives of their countries. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">International marketing and distribution of medical devices are also subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.

Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Also similar to the United States, when a drug-device combination product’s principal intended action is accomplished by the drug constituent part, the EU regulates the combination product as a medicinal product.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and became effective on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">40</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To obtain marketing approval of a drug in the EU, an applicant must submit an marketing authorization application (“MAA”) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in specific EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for an applicant to apply to one-member state to assess the application (the reference member state) and specifically list other member states in which it wishes to obtain approval (concerned member states). Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labelling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and each concerned member state. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application which is then reviewed and approved commented on by the concerned member states. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the EU, only products for which marketing authorizations have been granted may be promoted. A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, even if authorized to be marketed in the EU, prescription-only medicines may only be promoted to health care professionals, not the general public.

The MDD regulated the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives. The method of assessing conformity depended on the class of the product, but normally involved a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In 2017, European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), which replaced the existing MDD framework and provided three years for transition and compliance, for a final effective date of May 26, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the European Parliament voted in April 2020 to postpone implementation of the MDR by one year, giving the medical device industry and Notified Bodies until May 26, 2021 to come into compliance. The MDR changes several aspects of the existing regulatory framework for medical device marketing in Europe and is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of all medical devices marketed in the EU, which may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to place an innovative or high-risk medical device on the European market. Specifically, the MDR will require changes in the clinical evidence required for medical devices, post-market clinical follow-up evidence, annual reporting of safety information for Class III products, and bi-annual reporting for Class II products, unique device identification, or UDI, for all products, submission of core data elements to a European UDI database prior to placement of a device on the market, reclassification of medical devices, and multiple other labeling changes. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union and designated under the MDR is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. A CE certificate issued under the MDD before May 26, 2021 may remain valid until May 25, 2024 under certain conditions. However, we must acquire approvals under the MDR for new products and renew our existing CE mark certificates once our current certifications expire, which could be challenging and costly.</span></div><div style="text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div><div style="text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:115%">Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in Canada</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Health Canada is the Canadian federal authority that regulates, evaluates and monitors the safety, effectiveness, and quality of drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutic products available to Canadians. Health Canada’s regulatory process for review, approval and regulatory oversight of products is similar to the regulatory process conducted by the FDA.

This information is usually submitted in the form of a New Drug Submission, or NDS. Health Canada reviews the submitted information, sometimes using external consultants and advisory committees, to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of a drug. If after of the review, the conclusion is that the patient benefits outweigh the risks associated with the drug, the drug is issued a Drug Identification Number (“DIN”), followed by a Notice of Compliance (“NOC"), which permits the market authorization holder (i.e., the NOC and DIN holder) to market the drug in Canada.

These laws and regulations typically require the licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of product candidates and governmental review and approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic product candidates. Additionally, they may require adherence to the FDA’s GLPs, GCPs, and GMPs during manufacturing.

The  GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of European Union-based data subjects including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g. access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and a new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Further, EU member states have a broad right to impose additional conditions – including restrictions – on these data categories. This is because the GDPR allows EU member states to derogate from the requirements of the GDPR mainly in regard to specific processing situations (including special category data and processing for scientific or statistical purposes). As the EU states </span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">43</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">continue to reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant EU member states’ laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">We will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, if we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves or third parties outside of the EU. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU where there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard personal data (e.g. the European Union Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses).

Consequently, there is some risk of any data transfers from the European Union being halted. If we have to rely on third parties to carry out services for us, including processing personal data on our behalf, we are required under the GDPR to enter into contractual arrangements to help ensure that these third parties only process such data according to our instructions and have sufficient security measures in place. Any security breach or non-compliance with our contractual terms or breach of applicable law by such third parties could result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause customers to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse impact on our reputation and business. Any contractual arrangements requiring the transfer of personal data from the EU to us in the United States will require greater scrutiny and assessments as required under </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">Schrems II</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%"> and may have an adverse impact on cross-border transfers of personal data, or increase costs of compliance. The GDPR provides an enforcement authority to impose large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. We will be subject to the GDPR when we have a European Union presence or “establishment” (e.g., EU based subsidiary or operations), when conducting clinical trials with EU based data subjects, whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a vendor or partner, or offering approved products or services to EU-based data subjects, regardless of whether involving a EU based subsidiary or operations.  </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:115%">U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad.

Based on our current operating plan estimates, we do not have sufficient cash to satisfy our working capital needs and other liquidity requirements over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

If we cannot raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we will not be able to advance our product candidates as currently planned or grow our product portfolio, we will need to reevaluate our planned operations, we may relinquish rights under our license agreements with third parties relating to our product candidates, and we may need to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, reduce expenses or cease operations, any of which would have a significant negative impact on our prospects and financial condition, as well as the trading price of our common stock.

If we do not successfully complete a pivotal clinical trial of Ovaprene in a timely manner, the license grant may never become effective, and we may not receive any additional payments from Bayer. Bayer may elect not to make the license grant effective regardless of the outcome of the pivotal clinical trial. If an exclusive license agreement is terminated early or does not become fully effective, we may realize none or only a small fraction of the potential value of the agreement to us, and we may need to raise significant additional capital to pursue further development and commercialization of XACIATO or Ovaprene, as applicable.</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">  </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If these license agreements are not terminated and the license grants become effective, we expect XACIATO’s and Ovaprene’s value to us to be generated primarily through royalties based on net sales and achievement of commercial milestones.

Accordingly, if the licensee is not successful or has limited commercialization success, our ability to monetize XACIATO and, if approved, Ovaprene, may be significantly impaired and our need for additional capital could significantly increase. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the future, we may depend to a large degree on payments from third-party licensees to fund our operations, and failure to receive such payments may cause us to, among other things: </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">pursue raising additional funds through equity or debt financings that could be dilutive to our stockholders or involve restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">enter into new strategic collaborations that may be less favorable than those we would have obtained under different circumstances;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">delay, reduce or terminate one or more development programs;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">reduce headcount;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">forgo opportunities to expand our product portfolio; or</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%;padding-left:13.8pt">consider strategic transactions with a third party. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our ability to raise capital may be limited by laws and regulations.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2021 and through March&nbsp;30, 2022, we raised approximately $70.9 million in gross proceeds through the sale of equity securities under a Form S-3 “shelf” registration statement. Using a shelf registration statement to raise capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. We currently have a shelf registration statement effective, however, our ability to raise capital under this registration statement was in the past, and may again be in the future, limited by, among other things, current and future SEC rules and regulations impacting the eligibility of smaller companies to use Form S-3 for primary offerings of securities. For example, in fiscal year 2020, we were subject to the "baby shelf rule" because the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, was less than $75.0 million at the time we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and remained below $75.0 million during the year. As a result, that we were able to use our shelf registration statement to raise additional funds only to the extent that the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf pursuant to Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 during the 12 calendar months immediately prior to, and including, any intended sale did not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our public float, calculated in accordance with the instructions to Form S-3. In the future, if our public float were to decline below $75.0 million at the time we file our next annual report on Form 10-K, which will be due in March of 2023, we could again become subject to the baby shelf rule.

While our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we can maintain such listing. See, “Risks Related to Our Securities-There is no assurance that we will continue satisfying the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market,” below.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our ability to raise capital on a timely basis through the issuance and sale of equity securities may also be limited by Nasdaq’s stockholder approval requirement for any transaction that is not a public offering (as defined in Nasdaq listing rules). For transactions other than public offerings, Nasdaq requires stockholder approval prior to the issuance or potential issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) at a price per share that is less than the "Minimum Price" if the issuance (together with sales by our officers, directors and substantial shareholders (as defined in Nasdaq listing rules)) would equal 20% or more of our common stock outstanding before the issuance. Under Nasdaq rules, the "Minimum Price" means a price that is the lower of (i) the Nasdaq official closing price immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement; or (ii) the average Nasdaq official closing price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement. In addition, certain prior sales of securities by us may be aggregated with any offering we may propose at a price that is less than the Minimum Price and which is not considered a public offering by Nasdaq, further limiting the amount we could raise in the offering. Under Nasdaq rules, stockholder approval is also required prior to the issuance of securities when the issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control of our company. Even if a public offering under Nasdaq rules is not subject to the 20% limitation described above, it may involve publicly announcing the proposed transaction before it is completed, which often has the effect of depressing a company's stock price. Accordingly, our existing investors may suffer greater dilution if we seek to raise additional capital through such a public offering of our securities.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Furthermore, our ability to raise capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities is limited by the number of shares of our common stock that we are authorized to issue, and increasing the number of authorized shares of our common stock requires stockholder approval. Currently, we are authorized to issue up to 120,000,000 shares of our common stock and, as of March&nbsp;30, 2022, 92,244,591 shares of our common stock were outstanding or reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options or for future equity awards under our stock incentive plan, which leaves only 27,755,409 shares of our authorized common stock unreserved and available for issuance.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Obtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we must obtain stockholder approval to increase the amount of common stock we are authorized to issue or for a potential transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition, seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed increase in our authorized common stock or a proposed transaction. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are heavily reliant on our ability to raise capital through capital market transactions.

The product candidates we develop require substantial clinical testing to demonstrate that they are safe and effective for their proposed uses. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain.  A failure of one or more clinical trials could occur at any stage of testing.  The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a particular clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results of that trial.

If the designation were to be changed to CDER, or if either center were to institute additional requirements for the approval of Ovaprene, we could be required to complete clinical studies with more patients and over longer periods of time than is currently anticipated.

However, the FDA may determine that the results of the study are not sufficiently robust or convincing and require additional clinical and/or nonclinical studies prior to approval of Ovaprene. In addition, our ability to commence the pivotal clinical study of Ovaprene is subject to the FDA’s review and approval of an IDE, the timing of which will be later than we anticipated when we initiated the process based feedback from the FDA, and could delay or contribute to a delay in the commencement of the pivotal clinical study. Because Ovaprene is one of our lead product candidates, the impact of either a change in the lead FDA review center or the imposition of additional, currently unplanned requirements for approval could be significant to us and have a material adverse effect on the prospects for developing Ovaprene, as well as on our business and our financial condition.

For example, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is designed to work primarily by increasing blood flow to the genital tissue. Therefore, it will be critical for us to identify and enroll patients in our clinical trials of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for whom inadequate blood flow to the genital tissue is the primary contributor to their arousal disorder. If we fail to screen properly, and instead enroll patients with different contributing factors, the results of our clinical trials are unlikely to demonstrate effectiveness of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. Conversely, trying to screen out patients with different contributing factors may slow enrollment in a study, delay its completion and increase its costs. The pace of enrollment of participants in the study during 2021 was slower than expected. We identified a number of contributing factors and implemented mitigation strategies to increase study subject recruitment, however, the initial slower pace of enrollment lengthened our original estimated timeline for the study. We may experience additional delays in enrollment relative to what we currently anticipate, which may further lengthen the study timeline and increase its overall cost. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if we can identify and enroll a sufficient number of women for whom inadequate blood flow to the genital tissue is the primary contributing factor to their arousal disorder, there is no guaranty that the use of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will improve their general feelings of arousal or that the PRO instruments we utilize to measure the effectiveness of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% in the study will adequately capture their genital arousal response. Given the factors contributing to arousal disorders, we may be required to conduct clinical trials in large patient populations, extending the timeline and increasing the cost of development for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. For example, the total number of participants that the Phase 2b study will seek to randomize has not yet been determined and the high end of the range is almost 200 more participants than the low end. The final size of the study will be determined by a single interim analysis for unblinded sample size re-estimation, which analysis has not yet occurred. If the study requires a number of randomized participants on the high end of the range, then the study could take significantly longer and be significantly more expensive to complete than if the final size of the study need only be on the low end of the range. If we are unable to efficiently and successfully complete our Phase 2b clinical trial of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, product development costs for the program would increase significantly, and such failure could negatively impact the perception of the program’s potential for future clinical and regulatory success, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our stock price.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:112%">Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data, and others, including regulatory authorities, may not agree with our interpretation of study data.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">From time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial.

If the FDA determines that we may not use this regulatory pathway, then we would need to seek regulatory approval via a “full” or “stand-alone” NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. This would require us to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional safety and efficacy data and other information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval including possibly nonclinical data.

In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.

For example, while we believe the risk of adverse fetal development from using these product candidates is low, the impact of these product candidates on fetal development has not been studied and there are no adequate or well-controlled studies of these product candidates in pregnant women. Thus, the risk of adverse fetal development from any one or more of these product candidates may be greater than expected.

Pre-clinical candidates must generate sufficient safety and efficacy data through in vitro studies, animal studies and a variety of tests before they can be considered appropriate for testing in humans. The development risks, timeline and cost of pre-clinical assets can be high because of the unknowns and absence of data. It can be difficult to identify relevant tests and animal models for pre-clinical studies.

Accordingly, our revenues may be dependent on Organon’s ability to successfully market, sell and distribute XACIATO and to perform its contractual obligations. There is no assurance that the commercial launch of XACIATO will occur when expected or be successful and the timing and amount of potential payments to us under the license agreement is uncertain. Apart from Organon’s diligence obligation under our license agreement, we have no control over the efforts and resources Organon devotes to the marketing and sale of XACIATO. In addition, the effective date of the license agreement is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including antitrust law clearance which is outside of our control. The occurrence of any of the risks described above could negatively impact the commercial success of XACIATO and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Termination of the CRADA by NICHD or by us could significantly delay the commencement, conduct and/or completion of the Phase 3 study of Ovaprene and significantly increase the overall timeline and costs for development of Ovaprene. Though the CRADA has a five-year term, either party may terminate it for any reason or for no reason upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. If the CRADA is terminated before completion of the Phase 3 study of Ovaprene, NICHD will cooperate with us to transfer the data and the conduct of the study to us or our designee and will continue to conduct the study for so long as necessary to enable such transfer to be completed without interrupting the study. If we terminate the CRADA before the completion of any active study protocol, we generally will be responsible for providing sufficient clinical supplies of Ovaprene to NICHD in order to complete the study. NICHD may retain and use payments we make under the CRADA for up to one year after expiration or termination to cover costs associated with the conduct of activities described under the research plan in the CRADA that were initiated prior to expiration or termination. If we fail to make any scheduled payment to NICHD under the CRADA, the final one of which is due in the second quarter of 2023, NICHD is not obligated to carry out research and development activities until it receives the funds. Suspension by NICHD of activities under the CRADA or termination by NICHD or by us of the CRADA could have a material adverse effect on the Phase 3 study of Ovaprene and on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We face significant competition in seeking strategic collaborations.

The prospective collaborator may also have opportunities to collaborate with third parties on products or technologies that would compete with our products or product candidates and will evaluate whether those opportunities are more attractive than a collaboration with us. We also face competition in our search for collaborators from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, many of which are larger and able to offer more attractive deals in terms of financial commitments, contribution of human resources, or development, manufacturing, regulatory or commercial expertise and support.

We rely on third parties to supply and manufacture our product candidates and other materials necessary to commence and complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and other activities required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, and expect to continue to do so in the future. In addition, we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture the commercial supplies of XACIATO and any future products. This reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers subjects us to inherent uncertainties related to product safety, availability, security and cost.

We have entered into a long-term supply and manufacturing agreement for commercial supply of XACIATO with the same CMO that provided clinical supplies for our Phase 3 DARE-BVFREE clinical study. Under our supply and manufacturing agreement, we agreed to purchase at least 80% of our XACIATO requirements from the CMO, subject to limited exceptions. Currently, this CMO is our sole supplier of XACIATO. As a result, XACIATO’s commercial success will depend in part on the CMO's ability to manufacture and deliver adequate commercial quantities of the product on agreed upon timelines in accordance with our specifications and in compliance with cGMP and other applicable requirements. In addition, the CMO relies on other third parties, for supply of raw materials required to produce XACIATO and those supplies may become more difficult and costly to obtain. For example, the current single source supplier of clindamycin is located in China. Should this supplier slow production, shut down its factory or increase its prices for any reason, including due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical events, poor political relations between the U.S. and China and increased taxes or imposition of sanctions, our CMO may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of clindamycin to manufacture sufficient commercial quantities of XACIATO, which could impede XACIATO’s commercial success. If these circumstances were to occur, the CMO could be forced to source clindamycin from a different supplier, which could lead to higher costs to us and disruption in commercial supply of XACIATO. After Organon assumes the manufacturing and supply responsibilities for XACIATO, we will have no control over the production and supply of the product. Our failure, or after the transfer of manufacturing responsibilities, Organon’s failure, to produce, or cause to be produced, sufficient quantities of XACIATO for commercial sale could have a significant negative effect on commercialization efforts and the payments we receive under our license agreement.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our agreement with ADVA-Tec restricts our ability to engage a manufacturing source for Ovaprene other than ADVA-Tec during Ovaprene's development period as well as following regulatory approval, subject to limited exceptions. If ADVA-Tec fails to provide sufficient clinical supply of Ovaprene on anticipated timelines, our ability to complete clinical development and seek regulatory approval of Ovaprene could be significantly delayed. A substantial scale up in production of Ovaprene clinical supplies is necessary to support the planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of Ovaprene, which may not occur on projected timelines and may be more expensive for us than anticipated. If Ovaprene receives marketing approval, failure by ADVA-Tec to provide sufficient commercial product quantities at reasonable costs could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and ability to become profitable.

There are significant risks involved with establishing our own commercial infrastructure.

If we recruit and train a sales force and the commercial launch of the product is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred significant commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we could not retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. Both the launch and ongoing commercial support of our products would require significant capital, which may not be available to us when needed or on acceptable terms or at all.

XACIATO will compete with those products. Current therapies for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis primarily consist of oral and vaginal formulations of antibiotics delivered as a single dose or through multiple doses over consecutive days. Two of the most common antibiotics used today are generic clindamycin and metronidazole. In particular, XACIATO will likely be compared with Clindesse® (clindamycin phosphate) Vaginal Cream, 2% as this treatment is a vaginally administered, single dose cream formulation of clindamycin. If health care providers do not view the prescribing information for XACIATO, including the cure rates that XACIATO demonstrated in the Phase 3 DARE-BVFREE clinical study, as compelling compared with other products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, or if competitive products have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels than XACIATO, health care providers may opt to continue to prescribe existing treatments rather than recommend or prescribe XACIATO to their patients. In addition, women may prefer orally delivered options to vaginally administered XACIATO unless they view XACIATO as providing significantly superior efficacy, safety and/or convenience.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The women's health market includes many generic products and growth in generics is expected to continue, which could make the successful introduction of our branded products difficult and expensive.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The proportion of the U.S. market made up of generic products has been increasing.

Studies have failed to demonstrate that bio-identical hormones are safer than other hormones, so DARE-HRT1 will need to compete with many types of hormone therapy options in terms of convenience, safety and efficacy in managing symptoms of menopause.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Risks related to market acceptance of DARE-HRT1, if approved for hormone therapy, include:</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">preference for a vaginal ring delivery of hormone therapy over pills, patches and creams by menopausal women;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">data regarding symptom relief of DARE-HRT1 over other hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">preference for bio-identical hormones by women and health care providers;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">positive or negative news and research regarding bio-identicals;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">the success or failure of Bijuva®, the first FDA-approved bio-identical product;</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:3pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">new information supportive or against the use of hormones in menopause; and</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:54pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">availability of insurance reimbursement for DARE-HRT1.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">69</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Depending upon the direction of the factors above, a commercial market for DARE-HRT1 may develop more slowly than expected, or not at all, and our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects could be hurt as a result.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses for prescription medical products.

Promotional labeling and advertising for XACIATO, and for any other of our drug products that receive marketing approval, must be submitted to FDA at the time of first use and the agency actively solicits reports from health care professionals about improper promotional claims or activities by the drug manufacturer or distributor. Medical device promotion and advertising are subject to similar off-label restrictions, although without the same requirement to submit promotional materials to FDA at the time of first use. Both prescription drug and medical device promotional materials must present a fair balance between the product’s effectiveness and the risks associated with its use, and must be truthful and not misleading.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we or a commercial collaborator is alleged or found to have promoted XACIATO or any other future commercial product for any off-label use, we may become subject to significant liability and reputational harm. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper medical product promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. Other enforcement authorities may also take action against a company for promoting an off-label use of a prescription medical product, which could result in penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.

Market acceptance and sales of XACIATO and any future products that we or a commercial collaborator may seek to commercialize will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors, such as government health care programs, private health insurers, managed health care providers, and other organizations, are increasingly challenging medical product prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider XACIATO or any future product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies and medical products, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, even if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us, or a commercial collaborator, to sell our products on a profitable basis. Coverage decisions can depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new prescription medical products when more established or lower cost alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Third-party payor coverage may not be available to patients for XACIATO or any future product. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, health care providers may not prescribe our products or patients may ask their health care providers to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved prescription medical products, including coverage and payment. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for prescription medical products among third-party payors in the United States; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for our products could differ significantly from payor to payor. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medical products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medical product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations to a substantial degree in setting their own reimbursement policies, but they also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for XACIATO and any future products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Accordingly, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. Moreover, reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS, should XACIATO or any of our product candidates be approved for marketing in Europe.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations can influence decisions about reimbursement for new medical products by determining standards of care. In addition, many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provides guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of, and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit as compared to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of any of our commercialized products. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To secure coverage and reimbursement for XACIATO and any future product, we or a commercial collaborator may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product to third-party payors, which costs would be in addition to those required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.

Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payors increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for XACIATO or any future product, or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing levels, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, or those of a commercial collaborator. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, also may not be sufficient to cover our costs, or those of a commercial collaborator, and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Accordingly, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us or our commercial collaborator to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be cost prohibitive for health care providers or their patients, or less profitable than alternative treatments or products, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Our inability, or that of our commercial collaborator, to obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for XACIATO or any future product could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to execute our business strategy and our overall financial condition.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus of this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of health care and prescription drugs. Individual states in the United States have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Biden Administration has also indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, released a drug pricing plan in September 2021 that indicates the Administration supports aggressive actions such as allowing DHHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs. Such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions. It is uncertain whether and how future legislation or regulatory changes could affect prospects for XACIATO or our product candidates or what actions third-party payors may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms, may prevent or limit our ability, or the ability of a commercial collaborator, to commercialize XACIATO or any future products as well as our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Failure by us or a commercial collaborator to obtain timely and adequate coverage and pricing for XACIATO and any future products, or obtaining such coverage and pricing at unfavorable levels, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Even seemingly small copayments or other cost-sharing requirements could dramatically reduce the market potential for XACIATO and our product candidates.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If the out-of-pocket costs for XACIATO or any of our product candidates, if approved, are deemed by women to be unaffordable, a commercial market may never develop or the market potential for that product may be significantly reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and prospects.</span></div><div style="height:36pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">73</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:36pt;width:100%"><div><span><br></span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span><br></span></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">With regard to contraceptive products, the ACA and subsequent regulations enacted by DHHS, require health plans to provide coverage for women’s preventive care, including all forms of FDA-cleared or approved contraception, without imposing any cost sharing on the plan beneficiary. These regulations ensure that women in the U.S. who wish to use an approved form of contraception may request it from their doctors and their health insurance plan must cover all costs associated with such contraceptive products. In January 2022, the DHHS, Department of Labor, and Treasury Department jointly issued guidance on implementation of this ACA mandate, among other things. The recently issued federal guidance makes clear that all FDA-approved or cleared contraceptive products that are determined by an individual’s medical provider to be medically appropriate for such individual must be covered without-cost sharing, regardless of whether the product is specifically identified in a Birth Control Guide published by the FDA. Any future repeal or elimination of the ACA’s preventive care coverage rules would mean that women seeking to use prescribed forms of contraceptives may have to pay some portion of the cost for such products out-of-pocket, which could deter some women from using prescription contraceptive products or branded prescription contraceptive products, including Ovaprene and our other investigational contraceptive products, if and when approved by the FDA. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">As no FDA-approved treatments for FSAD currently exist, there is little precedent to help assess whether health insurance plans will cover Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% if approved.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, is being developed for female sexual arousal disorder, a life altering, but not a life threatening, condition, Hence, there is no assurance that third-party reimbursement will be available for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, if approved. Even if reimbursement becomes available, the amount of such reimbursement may not make our product affordable to women and profitable to us. Insurers may deem Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% to be a life-style drug and decide not to provide reimbursement. Today, many health insurance plans provide reimbursement for male sexual arousal medications. However, we cannot predict whether they will continue to do so or whether they will do so for FSAD treatments as well.  The safety and efficacy data from our clinical trials may impact whether Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will become eligible for insurance coverage, and if it does, the level of such reimbursement. In an environment of rapidly rising health care costs, insurers have been looking for ways to reduce costs, which could make it difficult for new therapies to gain coverage if they are not deemed medically critical or essential.

In addition to creating the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, the Hatch-Waxman Act amendments to the FDCA authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs. An ANDA relies on the nonclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved reference listed drug, or RLD, and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is “bioequivalent” to the RLD. The FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the RLD.

Accordingly, the data exclusivity period should block the FDA from approving either a subsequent ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that relies in whole or in part on our protected clinical data. We cannot predict the interest of potential follow-on competitors in the future XACIATO market, whether a third party will attempt to invalidate our period of exclusivity or otherwise force the FDA to take other actions, or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products after the FDA-granted data exclusivity period ends.

For example, in late 2021, companies across many industries began experiencing severe staffing shortages reportedly caused by work absences due to a surge in COVID-19 cases and an economic trend known as the Great Resignation in which employees are voluntarily quitting their jobs in large numbers. Due to our small workforce, if multiple employees become unable to work or were to resign at roughly the same time, our ability to effectively manage and operate our business could become significantly impaired and our expenses could increase materially, including as a result of expenditures related to recruiting, hiring and training qualified new employees and engaging additional consultants and service providers to perform the job responsibilities of the employees on leave or who resign.

The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents.

The advantage of being listed in the Orange Book is that, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, any future generic applicant for any of our approved products needs to include a patent certification in their generic application with respect to each patent listed in the Orange Book for an approved product (referred to as the “listed drug”) for which they are seeking approval. If the generic applicant believes that any of the patents in the Orange Book on the listed drug is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed by their product, the generic applicant usually will file a “Paragraph IV” certification on that patent if they plan to challenge the patent. When a generic applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, they must provide the listed drug applicant (and the patent owner if different) a notice that they filed a generic application with the Paragraph IV certification.  If, in reply to that notice, the listed drug holder files a patent lawsuit against the generic applicant within 45 days of the Paragraph IV notice, a 30-month automatic stay is imposed by the Hatch-Waxman Act on FDA during which FDA may not approve the generic application (unless the patent litigation is resolved in the generic applicant’s favor). These 30-month stays are major protection available in the Hatch-Waxman Act for innovative drug makers. However, if our products are approved, but one or more of our patents are not listed in the Orange Book, generic firms that might seek approval of a generic version of our product would not have to “certify” in their generic drug applications as to any such unlisted patent. This could result in the absence of a 30-month stay and thus faster approval of some generic applications for our products.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Other companies or individuals may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies.

For example, in the United States, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States, EU and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date.

If the patents are asserted against us, however, a court may disagree with our or our licensors’ determinations.

For example, clinical trial site initiation and/or patient enrollment may be significantly delayed or suspended as a result of personnel and other resource constraints of health care providers, as well as adherence to governmental orders and internal policies intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition, we may experience lower than anticipated subject enrollment and completion rates, including because individuals may avoid medical settings, particularly for non-critical conditions, due to concerns of contracting COVID-19 or due to shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, or conversely, as pandemic-related restrictions ease and there are increased opportunities to travel and participate in other activities again, individuals may be less inclined to participate in or complete clinical trials such as ours that require multiple clinic visits. Commencement and completion of our clinical trials may also be significantly delayed by disruptions to production by our contract manufacturers of clinical supplies needed for those studies. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a slower than anticipated pace of enrollment of participants in our Phase 2b clinical study of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% as a result of operational restrictions or closure of certain study sites due to their adherence to governmental guidelines intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

There can be no assurance we will succeed in preventing cyber security breaches or successfully mitigate their effects.  </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Despite implementing security measures, any of the computer systems belonging to us or our collaborators and third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failure. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. Any system failure, accident, security breach or data breach that causes interruptions in our own or in third-party service vendors’ operations could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, losing clinical study data from future clinical studies could result in delays in our or our collaborators’ regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs in order to recover or reproduce the lost data. In addition, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of personally identifiable information or protected health information could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data. Further, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure, which could disrupt our operations. If any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur resulting liability, our product development programs and competitive position may be adversely affected, the further development of our product candidates may be delayed, and the manufacture and sale of any approved products may be impaired. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.  </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable or unanticipated macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from geopolitical events, international economic sanctions or a global health emergency.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Interest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payors and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products, if and when approved.

The sales agent must use commercially reasonable efforts in conducting such sales activities consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations and applicable Nasdaq rules. If expressly authorized by us, the sales agent could also sell shares in privately negotiated transactions. We made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants to the sales agent in the October 2021 sales agreement, and we agreed to customary indemnification and contribution obligations, including with respect to liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Such activities will require a significant increase in investment in regulatory support, clinical supplies, inventory build-up related costs, and the payment of success-based milestones to licensors.

Preparing these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Historically, revisions to our estimates have not resulted in a material change to the financial statements. While our significant account policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we believe that the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Stock-Based Compensation</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award (determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model), and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).

Following commercial launch of XACIATO, we expect our general and administrative expenses will include payments by us to a third-party licensor, including royalty payments at rates in the high single-digit to low double-digits based on annual net sales of XACIATO. In 2022, in connection with commercialization of XACIATO in the U.S., these payments may include a milestone payment in the mid six-figures and royalty payments on net sales at a high single digit royalty rate.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Research and development expenses</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The increase of approximately $9.8 million in research and development expenses from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to increased research and development spend for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% related to the ongoing Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% Phase 2b RESPOND clinical trial of approximately $7.7 million. Also contributing to the increase were increases in (a) costs related to manufacturing and regulatory affairs activities for Ovaprene and development activities for our Phase 1 and Phase 1-ready programs of approximately $5.6 million, (b) personnel costs of approximately $553,000, and (c) stock-based compensation expense of approximately $298,000.

If we advance our programs as currently planned, our research and development expenses for 2022 could be more than double our research and development expenses for 2021. Our 2022 research and development expenses could include up to $4.0 million in milestone payments due under license agreements related to certain of our product candidates payable by us to our third-party licensors. As discussed below in the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations and successfully execute our current operating plan. The pace and extent of our research and development activities and, therefore, our research and development spend, will depend on our cash resources. We expect our research and development spend to vary across our fiscal quarters. In regard to Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, we anticipate that the costs of the Phase 2b RESPOND clinical trial will be approximately $20.0 million, approximately $8.8 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2021 and approximately $0.7 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2020.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">License fees</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The $16,667 increase in license expenses from 2020 to 2021 was attributable to an increase in license fees accrued or paid under our license agreement related to DARE-HRT1.

Historically, the cash used to fund our operations has come from a variety of sources and predominantly from sales of our common stock. During 2021, we received (1) approximately $68.5 million in net proceeds from ATM sales of shares of our common stock; (2) approximately $11.5 million in non-dilutive grant funding to advance DARE-LARC1 in non-clinical proof of principle studies; (3) approximately $6.8 million in net proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock under our equity line; and (4) approximately $0.5 million upon the exercise of warrants.</span></div><div style="margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations and to successfully execute our current business strategy. During 2022, we may receive up to $12.5 million under our license agreement for XACIATO, and we will continue to seek to raise capital through the sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM sales agreements, however, when we can effect such sales and the amount of shares we can sell depends on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. For the foreseeable future, we will evaluate and may pursue a variety of capital raising options on an on-going basis, including equity and debt financings, government or other grant funding, collaborations and strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, to cover our operating expenses, and the cost of any license or other acquisition of new product candidates or technologies. The amount and timing of our capital needs have been and will continue to depend highly on many factors, including the product development programs we choose to pursue, the pace and results of our clinical development efforts, and the nature and extent of expansion of our product candidate portfolio, if any. If we raise capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, we may have to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. There can be no assurance that capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us and our stockholders. In addition, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject us to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets. If we cannot raise capital when needed, on favorable terms or at all, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates, will need to reevaluate our planned operations and may need to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, reduce expenses file for bankruptcy, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

The Company's business strategy is to in-license or otherwise acquire the rights to differentiated product candidates in the Company's areas of focus, some of which have existing clinical proof-of-concept data, to take those candidates through mid to late-stage clinical development, and to establish and leverage strategic collaborations to achieve commercialization.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company's first product, XACIATO™, which was approved by the FDA in December 2021, is a single-dose vaginal gel prescription product for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in females 12 years of age and older.

The Company is also subject to several risks common to other companies in the industry, including rapid technology change, regulatory approval of products, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, success of third parties in the marketing, sale and distribution of the Company's products, competition from substitute products and larger companies, compliance with government regulations, protection of proprietary technology, and product liability.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The COVID-19 pandemic remains an evolving and uncertain risk to the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.

Continued uncertainty regarding the duration and impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economies, healthcare systems, workplace environments and capital markets, preclude any prediction as to the ultimate effect of the pandemic on the Company’s business. For further discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic, see the risk factor in Part I, Item 1A of this report titled, The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business and, in the future, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results and stock price, including by increasing the cost and timelines for our clinical development

consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a history of losses from operations, expects negative cash flows from its operations to continue for the foreseeable future, and expects that its net losses will continue for at least the next several years as it develops and seeks to bring to market its existing product candidates and potentially acquire, license and develop additional product candidates. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">At December&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $<span><ix:nonfraction unitref="usd" contextref="i67fb8606bc664994a45a74ac34daad03_I20211231" decimals="-5" sign="-" name="us-gaap:RetainedEarningsAccumulatedDeficit" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" scale="6" id="fact-identifier-266" inside-table="false" data-original-id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOjA2ZjNhODBiNzRiZDQ0NDE5NWNiZjVlMWE4ZjYzNDRlL3NlYzowNmYzYTgwYjc0YmQ0NDQxOTVjYmY1ZTFhOGY2MzQ0ZV8xODEvZnJhZzoyNmIyNWIyMGZkODY0NGM4YTk3OTkxNWQwNDIxODQ1ZC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOjI2YjI1YjIwZmQ4NjQ0YzhhOTc5OTE1ZDA0MjE4NDVkXzEzOTU_e9835a04-d1af-4fbb-b0ea-7d61fce73e60" continued-taxonomy="false" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isamountsonly="true" istextonly="false" iscalculationsonly="true" isnegativesonly="true" isadditionalitemsonly="false" isstandardonly="true" iscustomonly="false">110.1</ix:nonfraction></span> million, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $<span><ix:nonfraction unitref="usd" contextref="ie5dd5228f7aa4191b33da20447070bdd_I20211231" decimals="-5" name="us-gaap:ConvertibleDebt" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" scale="6" id="fact-identifier-267" inside-table="false" data-original-id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOjA2ZjNhODBiNzRiZDQ0NDE5NWNiZjVlMWE4ZjYzNDRlL3NlYzowNmYzYTgwYjc0YmQ0NDQxOTVjYmY1ZTFhOGY2MzQ0ZV8xODEvZnJhZzoyNmIyNWIyMGZkODY0NGM4YTk3OTkxNWQwNDIxODQ1ZC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOjI2YjI1YjIwZmQ4NjQ0YzhhOTc5OTE1ZDA0MjE4NDVkXzE0NTU_59231bf2-3100-4405-bb11-dba098bdf5b7" continued-taxonomy="false" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isamountsonly="true" istextonly="false" iscalculationsonly="false" isnegativesonly="false" isadditionalitemsonly="false" isstandardonly="true" iscustomonly="false">51.7</ix:nonfraction></span> million, and working capital of approximately $<span><ix:nonfraction unitref="usd" contextref="i67fb8606bc664994a45a74ac34daad03_I20211231" decimals="-5" name="dare:WorkingCapitalIncreaseDeficit" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" scale="6" id="fact-identifier-268" inside-table="false" data-original-id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOjA2ZjNhODBiNzRiZDQ0NDE5NWNiZjVlMWE4ZjYzNDRlL3NlYzowNmYzYTgwYjc0YmQ0NDQxOTVjYmY1ZTFhOGY2MzQ0ZV8xODEvZnJhZzoyNmIyNWIyMGZkODY0NGM4YTk3OTkxNWQwNDIxODQ1ZC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOjI2YjI1YjIwZmQ4NjQ0YzhhOTc5OTE1ZDA0MjE4NDVkXzE1MTQ_e349a043-0ff1-492e-a830-ff56c18070b3" continued-taxonomy="false" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isamountsonly="true" istextonly="false" iscalculationsonly="false" isnegativesonly="false" isadditionalitemsonly="false" isstandardonly="false" iscustomonly="true">39.2</ix:nonfraction></span> million.

The Company will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund its operations and to successfully execute its current strategy. The Company will continue to seek to raise capital through the sale of shares of its common stock under its ATM sales agreements, however, when the Company can effect such sales and the amount of shares the Company can sell depends on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of its common stock and its determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for its operations. For the foreseeable future, the Company will evaluate and may pursue a variety of capital raising options on an on-going basis, including equity and debt financings, government or other grant funding, collaborations and strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, to cover its operating expenses, and the cost of any license or other acquisition of new product candidates or technologies. The amount and timing of the Company's capital needs have been and will continue to depend highly on many factors, including the product development programs the Company chooses to pursue, the pace and results of its clinical development efforts, and the nature and extent of expansion of its product candidate portfolio, if any. If the Company raises capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, it may have to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to the Company, rights to some of its technologies or product candidates the Company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There can be no assurance that capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of the Company's existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject the Company to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in its assets. If the Company cannot raise capital when needed, on favorable terms or at all, the Company will not be able to continue development of its product candidates, will need to reevaluate its planned operations and may need to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs, reduce expenses, file for bankruptcy, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may have to liquidate its assets, and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on its condensed consolidated financial statements, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in the Company's common stock. The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</span></div></ix:continuation></span><span class="float-left text-block-indicator-left position-absolute" title="One or more textblock facts are between this symbol and the right side symbol."></span><span class="float-right text-block-indicator-right position-absolute" title="One or more textblock facts are between this symbol and the left side symbol."></span><span><ix:nonnumeric contextref="i35fc4512ab924b7b895c6e332a3a51d7_D20210101-20211231" name="us-gaap:ConsolidationPolicyTextBlock" id="fact-identifier-278" continuedat="idfc52553114949879cd6a6650a54474f" escape="true" inside-table="false" continued-main-taxonomy="true" data-original-id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOjA2ZjNhODBiNzRiZDQ0NDE5NWNiZjVlMWE4ZjYzNDRlL3NlYzowNmYzYTgwYjc0YmQ0NDQxOTVjYmY1ZTFhOGY2MzQ0ZV8xODEvZnJhZzoyNmIyNWIyMGZkODY0NGM4YTk3OTkxNWQwNDIxODQ1ZC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOjI2YjI1YjIwZmQ4NjQ0YzhhOTc5OTE1ZDA0MjE4NDVkXzI2NjMw_b81c0586-51b1-4def-ac1b-8cd816466f8c" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isamountsonly="false" istextonly="true" iscalculationsonly="false" isnegativesonly="false" isadditionalitemsonly="false" isstandardonly="true" iscustomonly="false"><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Principles of Consolidation</span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The consolidated financial statements of the Company are stated in U.S. dollars.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes Pricing Model to determine the fair value of each of the awards which considers factors such as expected term, volatility, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. Due to the limited history of the Company, the simplified method was utilized in order to determine the expected term of the awards. Additionally, the Company considered comparable companies in the industry which have available share price history to calculate the volatility. The Company compared U.S. Treasury Bills in determining the risk-free interest rate appropriate given the expected term. The Company has not established and has no plans to establish, a dividend policy, and the Company has not declared, and has no plans to declare dividends in the foreseeable future and thus no dividend yield was determined necessary in the calculation of fair value.</span></div></ix:nonnumeric></span><span class="float-left text-block-indicator-left position-absolute" title="One or more textblock facts are between this symbol and the right side symbol."></span><span class="float-right text-block-indicator-right position-absolute" title="One or more textblock facts are between this symbol and the left side symbol."></span><span><ix:nonnumeric contextref="i35fc4512ab924b7b895c6e332a3a51d7_D20210101-20211231" name="us-gaap:IncomeTaxPolicyTextBlock" id="fact-identifier-343" continuedat="ieeb3707d01724bceb22a81fcba85304f" escape="true" inside-table="false" continued-main-taxonomy="true" data-original-id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOjA2ZjNhODBiNzRiZDQ0NDE5NWNiZjVlMWE4ZjYzNDRlL3NlYzowNmYzYTgwYjc0YmQ0NDQxOTVjYmY1ZTFhOGY2MzQ0ZV8xODEvZnJhZzoyNmIyNWIyMGZkODY0NGM4YTk3OTkxNWQwNDIxODQ1ZC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOjI2YjI1YjIwZmQ4NjQ0YzhhOTc5OTE1ZDA0MjE4NDVkXzI2NjI4_728402e2-aa61-4d7b-a543-913d38a0a286" enabled-taxonomy="true" highlight-taxonomy="false" selected-taxonomy="false" hover-taxonomy="false" onclick="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onkeyup="Taxonomies.clickEvent(event, this)" onmouseenter="Taxonomies.enterElement(event, this);" onmouseleave="Taxonomies.leaveElement(event, this);" tabindex="18" isamountsonly="false" istextonly="true" iscalculationsonly="false" isnegativesonly="false" isadditionalitemsonly="false" isstandardonly="true" iscustomonly="false"><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Income Taxes </span></div><div style="margin-top:8pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC 740, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Income Taxes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.

The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
