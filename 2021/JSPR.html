are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to enabling cures through hematopoietic stem cell therapy. We are focused on the
development and commercialization of safer and more effective conditioning agents and stem cell engineering to allow for expanded use
of stem cell transplantation and ex vivo gene therapy, a technique in which genetic manipulation of cells is performed outside of the
body prior to transplantation.</span></p><div>

drug development pipeline includes multiple product candidates designed to improve hematopoietic stem cell therapy. Our lead product
candidate, JSP191, is in clinical development as a novel conditioning antibody that clears hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow
in patients prior to undergoing allogeneic stem cell therapy or stem cell gene therapy. We are also developing engineered hematopoietic
stem cells (“eHSC”) product candidates reprogrammed using mRNA delivery and gene editing that have a competitive advantage
over endogenous hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”) because they permit higher levels of engraftment without the need for toxic
conditioning of the patient and with potentially lower risk of other serious complications seen with current stem cell transplants. We
also plan to continue to expand our pipeline to include other novel stem cell therapies based on immune modulation, graft engineering
or cell and gene therapies. Our goal is to expand the use of curative stem cell transplant and gene therapies for all patients, including
children and the elderly.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 36pt">Stem cell transplantation is among the most widely
practiced forms of cellular therapy and has the potential to cure a wide variety of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders and
autoimmune diseases. A stem cell transplant procedure involves three main steps: (i) stem cells from the patient’s or donor’s
bone marrow are collected; (ii) the patient’s bone marrow is cleared of any remaining stem cells in order to make space to receive
new transplanted stem cells, which is known as conditioning; and (iii) the new stem cells are transplanted into the patient via infusion
where they fasten to, or engraft in, the bone marrow and grow into the blood and immune cells that form the basis of reset and rebuilt
blood and immune systems. Transplants are either allogeneic or autologous, depending on the source of the new stem cells for the transplant.
In an allogeneic transplant, patients receive cells from a stem cell donor. In an autologous transplant, the patient’s own stem
cells are used. Autologous transplants also include stem cell gene therapies, where cells are collected from the patient, edited to either
enable a functioning gene or correct a defective gene, and then transplanted into the patient via infusion. Our programs span both allogeneic
and gene therapy-based autologous transplants, with initial sponsored programs in JSP191 based on an allogeneic approach.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Currently,
patients must receive highly toxic and potentially life-threatening conditioning agents to prepare their bone marrow for transplantation
with either donor stem cells or their own gene-edited stem cells. Younger, fitter patients capable of surviving these toxic side effects
are typically given myeloablative, or high-intensity, conditioning whereas older or less fit patients are typically given reduced intensity,
but still toxic, conditioning which leads to less effective transplants. These toxicities include a range of acute and chronic effects
to the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, lung, endocrine, and neurologic tissues. Depending upon the conditioning regimen, fitness
of the patient, and compatibility between the donor and recipient, the risk of transplant-related mortality ranges from 10% to more than
50% in older patients. Less toxic ways to condition patients have been developed to enable transplant for older patients or those with
major comorbidities, but these regimens risk less potent disease elimination and higher rates of disease relapse. Even though stem cell
therapy can be one of the most powerful forms of disease cure, these limitations of non-targeted conditioning regimens have seen little
innovation over the past decade.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our lead product candidate, JSP191, is a monoclonal antibody designed
to block a specific survival signal on stem cells and is in development as a highly targeted conditioning agent prior to stem cell therapy.
We are developing JSP191 for severe combined immunodeficiency (“SCID”) for which we are currently conducting an open label
Phase 1/2 clinical trial in two cohorts of SCID patients: patients with a history of a prior allogeneic transplant for SCID but with poor
graft outcomes and newly diagnosed SCID patients. The primary endpoint in Phase 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JSP191.
The two primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 2 are the proportion of subjects achieving adequate donor HSC engraftment and the proportion
of subjects achieving naïve T cell production greater than or equal to 85 cells/uL, a level expected to provide immune reconstitution,
during weeks 36 to 104 post-transplant. Based on preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we believe JSP191 has
demonstrated the ability as a single agent to enable engraftment of donor HSCs as determined by donor chimerism, or the percentage of
bone marrow cells in the patient that are of donor origin after transplant. Six out of the first nine non-IL2RG patients with prior allogeneic
transplant achieved donor engraftment, naïve donor T cell production and demonstrated clinical improvement. No JSP191 treatment-related
serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported to date and pharmacokinetics have been consistent with earlier studies
in healthy volunteers. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial by mid-2023.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We also are evaluating JSP191 in an open label Phase 1 clinical trial
in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) or acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) that were transplant eligible
but still had trace evidence of leukemic cells that can remain in a patient after chemotherapy, or minimal residual disease (“MRD”),
as detected by cytogenetics, flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing. The primary endpoints are to evaluate the safety, tolerability
and pharmacokinetic parameters of JSP191. In the initial dose finding Phase 1a portion of this clinical trial, 0.6 mg/kg JSP191-based
conditioning was well tolerated in all six MDS/AML patients as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, it led to successful engraftment as
demonstrated by sustained blood neutrophil count of &gt;500 x 10^6 / L (Wolff 2002) in all six patients. Additionally, five of the six
patients demonstrated elimination of all diseased cells at day 90 (MRD) by multiple methods of detection, a secondary endpoint of the
clinical study. The next portion of the clinical trial, a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort has completed enrollment. Initial results from
the first seventeen patients show that 0.6 mg/kg JSP191-based conditioning was well tolerated with all seventeen patients achieving successful
engraftment. These initial results also show that twelve of fifteen Phase 1a and 1b patients with MRD at screening achieved clearance
of MRD. No JSP191-related serious adverse events have been reported. As of reporting of these initial results, four patients have come
off study, two due to relapse or disease progression, one due to late onset Grade 3 acute Graft vs Host Disease (“GvHD”) and
one due to secondary graft failure. We expect to present additional data from this study in the first half of 2022.</p><div>

to study JSP191-based conditioning in patients with Fanconi anemia. This study is currently open for patient recruitment. We are also
collaborating with the National Institutes of Health to conduct clinical trials of JSP191-based conditioning in patients with sickle cell
disease (“SCD”), with chronic granulomatous disease and with GATA-2 mutated MDS. We believe that JSP191 may also be useful
for conditioning in allogenic transplant for other diseases beyond which we are currently studying, including autoimmune diseases. We
also believe that targeted JSP191-based conditioning may improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapies. We are also collaborating
with corporate partners, including Graphite Bio, Inc. (“Graphite Bio”), Aruvant Sciences GmbH (“Aruvant Sciences”)

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 36pt">We plan to evaluate JSP191 as a therapeutic for
certain patients with proliferative disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder of the bone marrow which
typically occurs in an older population and can progress to AML. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (“IPSS-R”)
is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate risk and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients. Patients with IPSS-R scores of low or
very low are not typically referred to stem cell transplant due to the risk of transplant-related toxicities from current conditioning
regiments, infection and GvHD outweighing the patient’s expected survival with drug therapies. These patients typically suffer
from anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and are given drug therapies such as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (“ESA”)
to stimulate production of new cells to correct their blood deficiency. However, these agents do not target the diseased hematopoietic
stem cell and patients who become refractory to ESA are dependent on routine blood transfusions, which is associated with poor survival.
ESA-refractory low-risk MDS patients have few treatment options and are a clinical unmet need.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 36pt">JSP191 and other anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies
have been shown to deplete normal and diseased MDS human hematopoietic stem cells in clinical and pre-clinical studies. In studies of
non-human primates and healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of JSP191 resulted in depletion of healthy hematopoietic stem
cells followed by recovery in approximately six weeks. Additional recent clinical data in MDS patients undergoing stem cell transplant
showed depletion of hematopoietic stem cells after administration of JSP191 alone. By depleting diseased and healthy hematopoietic stem
cells, we believe that JSP191 may allow for preferential recovery of healthy hematopoietic stem cells and restoration of normal hematopoiesis.
We intend to study JSP191 monotherapy in low-risk MDS patients with documented cytopenia who are refractory to ESA therapy.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our eHSC platform is designed to overcome key
limitations of stem cell transplant and stem cell gene therapy. By using mRNA delivery and/or gene editing, we believe we can reprogram
donor or gene corrected stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage over the patient’s existing cells.
We believe initial preclinical experiments by Jasper demonstrate multiple different mRNAs can be used to improve engraftment of modified
stem cells. One example are eHSCs that express certain variants of CXCR4 that may lead to improved stem cell homing and engraftment in
the bone marrow. Another example includes expression of a modified stem cell factor receptor that can lead to cell line proliferation
independent of stem cell factor (“SCF”) concentration, enabling our eHSCs to outcompete unmodified HSCs through better survival
and engraftment. Also, since JSP191 only blocks signaling through the stem cell factor receptor, these eHSCs are not affected by JSP191
when used in combination. Other initial experiments have shown that mRNA can be used to express these receptor variants on the cell surface.
We have also identified other potential receptor modifications that prevent the binding of JSP191 but retain the ability to bind SCF,
therefore allowing the eHSCs to proliferate normally even in the presence of JSP191.</p><div>

believe JSP191 is a unique, humanized, monoclonal antibody that targets the underlying biology of hematopoietic stem cells to potentially
improve the efficacy and safety of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. JSP191 is in clinical development as a conditioning agent
to clear hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow prior to transplant. JSP191 binds to human CD117, a receptor for SCF, which is
expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The interaction of SCF and CD117 is required for stem cells to survive.
By blocking SCF from binding to CD117 and disrupting critical survival signals, JSP191 leads to the depletion of stem cells and creates
an open space in the bone marrow for donor or gene-edited stem cells to engraft. JSP191 is in clinical development both as a single conditioning
agent and in combination with existing conditioning agents depending on the need in a particular indication.</span></p><div>

and autologous gene-edited stem cell transplants. By delivering mRNA or modifying DNA, leading to expression of a modified receptor or
protein, we can reprogram donor or gene-edited stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage over the patient’s
existing cells to permit higher levels of engraftment without the need for toxic conditioning of the patient. eHSCs have the potential
to eliminate the need for donor T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells which are needed in unmodified donor HSC grafts to permit robust engraftment
but can lead to GvHD, where the donor cells attack the patient’s tissues, resulting in the need for long-term immunosuppression
therapies.</p><div>

is among the most widely practiced forms of cellular therapy and has the potential to cure a wide variety of diseases. Currently, its
use is limited to patients with severe disease burden due to the toxicities of current non-targeted conditioning regimens and the limitations

cell transplants first require identification of a suitable donor and collection of the donor’s stem cells, typically from blood.
Then chemotherapy or radiation-based conditioning is used to clear the patient’s bone marrow of existing diseased stem cells in
order to make space to receive new transplanted stem cells. Finally, the donor or gene corrected stem cells are infused into the patient
where they engraft into the bone marrow and produce new blood and immune cells that form the basis of a reset and rebuilt blood and immune
system. All transplants are categorized as either autologous or allogeneic, depending on the source of the new stem cells for the transplant.</span></p><div>

collected from the patient, edited to either insert a functioning gene into, or correct a defective gene within, such cells and then
such cells are transplanted into the patient via infusion.</span></p><div>

potentially life-threatening and non-specific conditioning agents to prepare their bone marrow for transplantation with either donor
stem cells or their own gene-edited stem cells. Current conditioning agents are genotoxic and are associated with major toxicities and
adverse events such as oral mucositis, sepsis, veno-occlusive disease, bacteremia, pulmonary fibrosis, and GvHD in the near term. In
the long term, patients must be counseled against risk of infertility of up to 70% and risk of secondary cancers of 5-10% after chemotherapy
conditioning. Additionally, there is a treatment-related mortality risk associated with current conditioning regimens that ranges from
10% to more than 50% in older patients. Other limitations of chemotherapy-based conditioning include incomplete engraftment, transplant
ineligibility and prolonged hospitalization.</p><div>

around failed or poor engraftment with the risk of clinical relapse. Furthermore, GvHD is a high-risk short- and long-term adverse event
associated with HSCT as a result of donor T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells which are needed in unmodified donor HSC grafts to permit robust
engraftment. Donor immune cells may react to the patient’s tissues as foreign leading to GvHD whereas newly produced immune cells
are trained by the patient’s body to not act against the patient’s own cells. Due to this risk, patients also need to undergo
long-term immunosuppression.</p><div>

are developing a conditioning agent that could significantly expand the eligible patient population for both allogeneic and autologous

efficacy with reduced complications. Currently, approximately 20,000 patients receive allogeneic and autologous gene therapy transplants
each year in the major global markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Japan), and we believe
this may grow to 80,000 patients with safe conditioning and more effective grafts.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">JSP191
is a targeted anti-CD117 (stem cell factor receptor) antibody which we are currently evaluating in two clinical trials for conditioning
prior to stem cell transplant in patients with SCID, MDS or AML. JSP191 is designed to bind to CD117 with a greater affinity than SCF.
By blocking signaling of the stem cell factor receptor, JSP191 leads to depletion of stem cell from the bone marrow. JSP191 was also
designed to minimize any interaction with the immune system thereby reducing the risk of immune activation via mast cells or other pathways
normally activated by antibodies.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">We
believe these attributes will allow JSP191 to potentially be used as a monotherapy or in combination to deplete normal and diseased stem
cells. The blocking of SCF by JSP191 may remove a critical survival signal on stem cells that leads to their depletion in the bone marrow.
Other cells (mast cells, Cajal cells, germ cells, melanocytes) that express CD117 are less dependent on SCF signaling for survival and
do not appear to be significantly affected by a single administration of JSP191. Furthermore, the mechanism of action (“MOA”)
of JSP191 on stem cells may be synergistic with other disruptors of stem cell survival such as radiation, azacytidine, and CD47. Our
MDS/AML clinical strategy aims to exploit this biology to safely clear both diseased and normal stem cells prior to transplantation of
donor cells.</span></p><div>

monoclonal antibody isotype and other modifications of JSP191 were also chosen carefully to retain high affinity binding to the CD117
receptor and SCF signal blockade without recruiting other immune cells that could lead to receptor activation, mast cell degranulation
or other off-target toxicities. For example, simply changing JSP191 from an IgG1 isotype to an IgG2 isotype would result in less potent
inhibition of CD117, potentially decreasing the effect on stem cell depletion. This finding and other data demonstrate that not all anti-CD117
antibodies behave equally or have the same MOA.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">Other
known approaches to target CD117, such as anti-CD117 antibodies linked to a toxin, may have off-target toxicity. In contrast to JSP191,
which provides a transient SCF signal blockade, a toxin linked anti-CD117 antibody requires internalization by CD117 expressing cells
leading to cell death. Any CD117 expressing cell including stem cells, mast cells, germ cells and melanocytes may be affected by this
mechanism. Furthermore, the complexity of an antibody-drug conjugate molecule adds to the manufacturing, clinical and regulatory risks
of the drug development process, especially for a novel linker/payload combination that may be subject to different regulatory and Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) reviews.</span></p><div>

cytometry, a technique used to measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells, whether homologous subsets of
NHP bone marrow express the same cellular markers as human HSCs (CD34, CD90, and CD117), and if the human antibody reagents used to identify
these markers could also be used for NHP HSCs. Bone marrow samples (or bone marrow aspirates) of NHPs and humans were stained with the
antibody reagents directed against human CD34, CD90, and CD117. HSCs in both human and NHP bone marrow were phenotypically identified
using the anti-human antibodies against CD34 and CD90. A high percentage of human and NHP cells expressing CD34 and CD90 (also CD34+

associated with the lowest rates of disease relapse. However, due to significant toxicities, including treatment related mortality, this
approach is reserved for the most fit and younger patients. Reduced intensity conditioning with lower dose busulfan or lower dose melphalan
can be used for a wider group of patients, but due to substantial toxicities, many patients remain ineligible. Non-myeloablative conditioning
with low dose radiation (200 – 450 cGy, or centigray, a unit of radiation of exposure) is well tolerated but is associated with
lower rates of successful donor chimerism and increased relapse rates compared to myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning.</span></p><div>

to their age and co-morbidities, older (60 years and older) and less fit MDS and AML patients are typically unable to tolerate more intensive

and effective conditioning prior to HSCT represents an unmet medical need for MDS and AML patients.</span></p><div>

the transient depletion of high-risk MDS cells, studies were conducted to determine whether an anti-CD117 antibody followed by a normal

with the chemotherapy regimens used in standard allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (“HCT”) to deplete endogenous

but often experience incomplete immune reconstitution characterized by inadequate T cell numbers and/or ongoing deficiency of B cell

label clinical trial to evaluate JSP191 as the sole conditioning agent to achieve HSC engraftment in patients undergoing transplant for
SCID. The primary endpoint in Phase 1 is to assess the safety and tolerability of JSP191 as a conditioning agent in SCID patients. The
two primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 2 are the proportion of patients achieving adequate donor HSC engraftment and the proportion
of patients achieving naïve CD4+ T cell production greater than or equal to 85 cells/uL, a level expected to provide immune reconstitution,
during weeks 36 to 104 post-transplant. Secondary endpoints include durability of naïve T cell production, incidence and severity
of GvHD, hematopoietic recovery and pharmacokinetic properties of JSP191. Patients receive a single IV infusion of JSP191 on study day
0 in one of four dose cohorts: 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. Patients will be followed for five years following transplant.
This trial is currently open for enrollment at multiple clinical trial sites in the United States.</p><div>

studies of SCID patients have shown functional T and B cell reconstitution in patients achieving long-term myeloid donor chimerism of
at least 3%. SCID patients who fail to achieve durable donor cell engraftment from a first transplant may not be candidates for a second
transplant using current conditioning agents due to the toxicity of the conditioning regimen and fragile nature of most SCID patients.
These patients may remain on medically supportive immune therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) or receive
an unconditioned “boost” transplant of donor cells which does not lead to sustained production of new immune cells.</span></p><div>

on naïve CD4+ T-cell levels and has shown clinical benefit in SCID patients in a re-transplant and first transplant setting. Patients
have shown resolution of chronic infections, independence from or reduction of IVIG therapy and antibody response to vaccine challenge.
Through December 31, 2021 in this open label clinical trial, fifteen re-transplant patients and three first transplant patients have been
treated in the ongoing SCID Phase 1/2 study. Most of the transplanted patients have shown engraftment of donor cells and production of
functional immune cells over up to three years of follow up (Figure 7). No JSP191 treatment related SAEs have been reported through December
31, 2021 in this clinical trial. Since starting the study in March 2017, SAEs in seven patients have been reported, including fever, infections
and hypocalcemia. None were related to treatment as determined by the investigator. Based on initial efficacy and safety results, we opened

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">A transforming event in hematopoietic stem cells
can produce several different malignancies. Cancer stem cells possess qualities of self-renewal, prolonged survival, and the ability
to give rise to cells with more differentiated characteristics. The idea that cancer is primarily driven by a smaller population of stem
cells has important implications. For instance, many chemotherapies can shrink tumors or deplete downstream differentiated cells, but
if the therapies do not kill cancer stem cells, the tumor will grow back.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">It has been shown that HSCs are the disease-initiating
cells in cancers like MDS, and that these pathogenic MDS HSCs outcompete normal HSCs present in the bone marrow of affected patients.
Furthermore, these disease-initiating HSCs express CD117, and anti-CD117 antibodies can target and eradicate these pathogenic cells.
This is especially significant in a disease like MDS where available therapies either lack disease-modifying activity or possess off-target
toxicity, preventing their use in older and/or fragile individuals who comprise most of the patients affected by MDS. Development of
anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies, which might be safely used for targeting MDS clones, would represent a major step forward for this
disease.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We plan to evaluate JSP191 as a therapeutic for
certain MDS patients. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (“IPSS-R”) is a clinical assessment tool used to
evaluate risk and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients. Patients with IPSS-R scores of low or very low are not typically referred to
stem cell transplant due to the risk of transplant-related toxicities from current conditioning regiments, infection and GvHD outweighing
the patient’s expected survival with drug therapies. These patients typically suffer from anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia
and are given drug therapies such as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (“ESA”) to stimulate production of new cells to
correct their blood deficiency. However, these agents do not target the diseased hematopoietic stem cell and patients who become refractory
to ESA are dependent on routine blood transfusions, which is associated with poor survival. ESA refractory low or very low risk MDS patients
have few treatment options and are a clinical unmet need.</p><div>

have been shown to deplete normal and diseased MDS human hematopoietic stem cells in clinical and pre-clinical studies. In studies in
non-human primates and healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of JSP191 resulted in depletion of healthy hematopoietic stem
cells followed by recovery in approximately six weeks. Dr. Wendy Pang demonstrated at Stanford that our anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody
called JSP191 is capable of depleting MDS HSCs in vivo in a xenografted mouse model. New data from our MDS/AML trial of JSP191 as a conditioning
agent have revealed that the antibody can have a direct depletion effect on CD34+CD45-CD117+ cells prior to administration of fludarabine
or radiation. By depleting diseased and healthy hematopoietic stem cells, we believe that JSP191 may allow for preferential recovery
of healthy hematopoietic stem cells and restoration of normal hematopoiesis.</p><div>

IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational
clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes
effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct
of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that
case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.</span></p><div>

a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms
originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or
at any time during the IND review process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds are imposed by
the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety, may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, preclinical,
and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls or where there is non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the
FDA would delay either a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately
addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in
completing our planned clinical trial or future clinical trials in a timely manner.</span></p><div>

trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition
to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted
under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used

sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical
trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When
a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements
of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that
such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent
from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations
are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and
integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required
for clinical trials in the United States.</span></p><div>

trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors,
the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a
finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed
to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.</span></p><div>

and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer.
For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for
which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate
the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission
grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.</span></p><div>

uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by
the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments
for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of
the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement
is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are
approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health
programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage,
and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage
for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once
coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing
the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage
to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular
indication.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">In
order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic
studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain
FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product
candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally,
a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further,
one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement
for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement
and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment
in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage
and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement
applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products will apply to any companion diagnostics.</span></p><div>

containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals
have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price
controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment
measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s
revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive
marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.</span></p><div>

discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage

We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.</span></p><div>

the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities
can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that
compares the cost-effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical
trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">In
the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be
marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare
the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in
order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict
the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal
products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of
direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies
to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.
Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could
continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced
by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has
become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory
developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained.
Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member
states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for
pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.</span></p><div>

dedicated to enabling cures through hematopoietic stem cell therapy and have a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical
product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential
product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially
viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue
to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable
and have incurred losses and negative operating cash flows in each period since our inception. For the&nbsp;years ended December&nbsp;31,
2021 and 2020, we reported net losses of $30.6&nbsp;million and $31.7&nbsp;million, respectively. For the&nbsp;years ended December&nbsp;31,
2021 and 2020, we reported negative operating cash flows of $33.7&nbsp;million and $18.3&nbsp;million, respectively. As of December 31,
2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $67.5 million. We have devoted all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business
and scientific planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking
research and preclinical studies of potential product candidates, developing manufacturing capabilities and evaluating a clinical path
for our pipeline programs. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future,
and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product
candidates.</p><div>

or through collaborators, eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential. This will require us to be
successful in a range of challenging activities, including identifying product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical
trials of product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products
for which we may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements.</span></p><div>

may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve
profitability. Our product candidates and research programs are currently only in the early stages of development. Because of the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when
we will become profitable, if at all. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly
or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to
raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A&nbsp;decline in the value
of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.</span></p><div>

for federal income tax purposes of&nbsp; $53.1&nbsp;million that can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December&nbsp;31, 2021, we
had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $45.4&nbsp;&nbsp;million that begin to expire in&nbsp;2038. Portions
of these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the legislation
enacted in&nbsp;2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), U.S.&nbsp;federal net operating losses incurred in taxable&nbsp;years beginning
after December&nbsp;31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses in taxable&nbsp;years
beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2020 is limited. It is uncertain how various states will respond to the Tax Act and the CARES Act. For
state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited,
which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. In addition, under Sections&nbsp;382 and&nbsp;383 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership
change,” which is generally defined as a greater than&nbsp;50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period,
the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its
post-change income or taxes may be limited. Our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising out of
previous ownership changes and we may be limited as to the amount that can be utilized each year as a result of such previous ownership
changes, including the Business Combination and related transactions. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including future
offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes. We have completed
a Section&nbsp;382 analysis covering taxable periods from its inception through the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2021. We experienced
an ownership change on November&nbsp;21, 2019 for both federal and California tax purposes related to its Series&nbsp;A redeemable convertible
preferred stock financing. Any net operating loss generated for taxable periods in 2018 and through November&nbsp;21, 2019 in excess of
$2.87&nbsp;million will be permanently limited for California tax purposes. We reduced our California net operating loss deferred tax
assets balance by the permanently limited amount of $0.6&nbsp;million. There would be no permanent loss of federal net operating loss
based on the limits. We experienced an additional ownership change on September 24, 2021. However, we do not expect there are additional
tax attributes that will expire unused before the expiration periods. There is a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets,
including net operating loss carryforwards for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2021.</p><div>

financial markets. This disruption, if sustained or recurrent, could make it more difficult for us to access capital, which could in
the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 or the
global impacts thereof could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues
to evolve, and its ultimate impact or that of any similar health pandemic or epidemic is highly uncertain. We do not yet know the full
extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our planned and ongoing clinical trials, the hospitals and healthcare systems
or the global economy as a whole. These effects could have an adverse impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19
situation closely.</span></p><div>

to allogenic transplant for patients with AML or MDS, and are planning a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of JSP191 as a conditioning agent
prior to allogenic transplant, all of our other product development programs, including our eHSC program, are still in the research or
preclinical stage of development. Our research programs may fail to identify additional product candidates for clinical development for
a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates, our potential product
candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects in preclinical in vitro experiments or animal model studies, they may not show promising
signals of efficacy in such experiments or studies or they may have other characteristics that may make the product candidates impractical
to manufacture, unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval. The historical failure rate for product candidates is high due
to risks relating to safety, efficacy, clinical execution, changing standards of medical care and other unpredictable variables. In addition,
although we believe our technology platform will position us to rapidly expand our portfolio of product candidates beyond our current
product candidates, our ability to expand our portfolio may never materialize.</span></p><div>

outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results
of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in the results of completed clinical trials. There can be no assurance that any
of our current or future preclinical and clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further preclinical or clinical development
of any of our product candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks
in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design
of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial
may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily
in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates. In addition,
preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory
approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory
policy during the period of product development. Any such adverse events may cause us to delay, limit or terminate planned clinical trials,
any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</span></p><div>

clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline

because of negative publicity from adverse events related to the biotechnology, gene therapy or genome engineering fields, competitive
clinical trials for similar patient populations, clinical trials in competing products or for other reasons. As a result, the timeline

are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development
of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we have product candidates and research programs. Some of these competitive
products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely
different approaches. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and
new therapies that may become available in the future that are approved to treat the same diseases for which we may obtain approval for
our product candidates. This may include other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody and/or protein therapies.</span></p><div>

of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, may have significantly greater financial
resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory

industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies
may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These
competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical
trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize product candidates that
are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our product candidates
or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval
for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a
strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our
product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any product candidates against competitors.</span></p><div>

addition, genome engineering technology is subject to public debate and heightened regulatory scrutiny due to ethical concerns relating
to the application of genome engineering technology to human embryos or the human germline. For example, in the United&nbsp;States, germline
alteration for clinical application has been expressly prohibited since enactment of a December&nbsp;2015 FDA ban on such activity. Prohibitions
are also in place in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, across most of Europe, in China and many other countries around the world. In the United&nbsp;States,
the National Institutes of Health has announced that the agency would not fund any use of gene engineering technologies in human embryos,
noting that there are multiple existing legislative and regulatory prohibitions against such work, including the Dickey-Wicker Amendment,
which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human
embryos are destroyed. Adverse events in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or those of our competitors or of academic researchers

product candidates require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most chemical and other biological pharmaceuticals.
Moreover, unlike chemical and other biological pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a gene-engineered cell therapies
cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product candidate may not be sufficient to ensure that the product
candidate will perform in the intended manner. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process,
could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims, insufficient
inventory or potentially delay progression of our clinical trials. If we successfully develop product candidates, we may encounter problems
achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other comparable applicable foreign standards
or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. In addition, our product candidates will require complicated
delivery modalities, such as electroporation, which will introduce additional complexities into the manufacturing process.</span></p><div>

consist of engineered human cells, and the process of manufacturing such product candidates is complex, concentrated with a limited number
of suppliers, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks. Manufacturing such product candidates involves harvesting cells from a
donor or from the patient, altering the cells <i>ex vivo</i> using genome engineering technology, cryopreservation, storage and eventually
shipment and infusing the cell product into the patient’s body. Our manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or
failure, or product variation that may negatively impact patient outcomes, due to logistical issues associated with the collection of
starting material from the donor, shipping such material to the manufacturing site, shipping the final product back to the clinical trial
recipient, preparing the product for administration, infusing the patient with the product, manufacturing issues or different product
characteristics resulting from the differences in donor starting materials, variations between reagent lots, interruptions in the manufacturing
process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency
in cell growth and variability in product characteristics. our manufacturing process, like that of a number of other cell therapy companies,
is also characterized by limited numbers of suppliers, and in some cases sole source suppliers, with the manufacturing capabilities and
know-how to create or source the materials, such as donor marrow cells and electroporation machines, used in our cell manufacturing.
While we pursue multiple sources for the critical components of our manufacturing process, we may not be successful in securing these
additional sources at all or on a timely basis. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates
or in any of the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates or other materials are made, such manufacturing facilities
may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.</span></p><div>

If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory

that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and

cell transplant has the potential to cure patients across multiple diseases, but its use carries with it risks of toxicity, serious adverse
events and death. Because many of our therapies are used to prepare or treat patients undergoing stem cell transplant, patients in our
clinical trials or patients that use any of our product candidates may be subject to many of the risks that are currently inherent to
this procedure. In particular, stem cell transplant involves certain known potential post-procedure complications that may manifest several&nbsp;weeks
or&nbsp;months after a transplant and that may be more common in certain patient populations. For example, up to&nbsp;20% of patients
with inherited metabolic disorders treated with a transplant experience primary engraftment failure, resulting in severe complications,
including death. Another example is autoimmune cytopenia, a known and severe frequent complication of the transplant procedure in patients
with non-malignant diseases, such as inherited metabolic diseases, that can result in death. There is also a risk of graft-versus-host
disease, a potentially serious complication in which the grafted cells attack and damage the patient’s healthy cells, which can
be severe and sometimes life-threatening. If these or other serious adverse events, undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics
are identified during the development of any of our product candidates, we may need to limit, delay or abandon our further clinical development
of those product candidates, even if such events, effects or characteristics were the result of stem cell transplant or related procedures
generally, and not directly or specifically caused or exacerbated by our product candidates. All serious adverse events or unexpected
side effects are continually monitored per the clinical trial’s approved protocol. If serious adverse events are determined to
be directly or specifically caused or exacerbated by our product candidates, we would follow the trial protocol’s requirements,
which call for our data safety monitoring committee to review all available clinical data in making a recommendation regarding the trial’s
continuation.</span></p><div>

other harmful effects in patients that use our therapeutic products after they are on the market, which may result in the limitation
or withdrawal of our drugs from the market. Alternatively, we may not be able to conduct such additional trials, which might force us
to abandon our efforts to develop or commercialize certain product candidates. Even if post-approval studies are not requested or required,
after our products are approved and are on the market, there might be safety issues that emerge over time that require a change in product
labeling, additional post-market studies or clinical trials, imposition of distribution and use restrictions under a REMS or withdrawal
of the product from the market, which would cause our revenue to decline.</span></p><div>

regulatory requirements that will govern any eHSCs or other novel genetically engineered product candidates we develop may change. Within
the broader genetic medicine field, we are aware of a limited number of gene therapy products that have received marketing authorization
from the FDA and the EMA.&nbsp;Even with respect to more established products that fit into the categories of gene therapies or cell
therapies, the regulatory landscape is still developing. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products and cell therapy products
have changed frequently and will likely continue to change in the future. Moreover, there is substantial, and sometimes uncoordinated,
overlap in those responsible for regulation of existing gene therapy products and cell therapy products. For example, in the United&nbsp;States,
the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (“OTAT”) within its Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (“CBER”) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies
Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. In addition to FDA oversight and oversight by IRBs under guidelines promulgated by the
National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an institutional
biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. Before a clinical study can begin at any institution, that institution’s
IRB&nbsp;and its IBC&nbsp;assess the safety of the research and identify any potential risk to public health or the environment. While
the NIH guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH
funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the
NIH guidelines voluntarily follow them. Moreover, serious adverse events or developments in clinical trials of gene or cellular therapy
product candidates conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to initiate a clinical hold on our clinical trials
or otherwise change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene
or cellular therapy protocols may proceed, the review process and determinations of other reviewing bodies can impede or delay the initiation
of a clinical trial even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation.</span></p><div>

for marketing authorization for a cell or gene therapy or other novel therapeutic medicinal candidate that is submitted to the Committee
for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) before CHMP adopts its final opinion. In the European Union, the development
and evaluation of an advanced therapeutic medicinal product must be considered in the context of the relevant European Union guidelines.
The EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for these medicinal products and require that
we comply with these new guidelines. As a result, the procedures and standards applied to gene and cell therapy products may be applied
to our eHSCs, but that remains uncertain at this point.</span></p><div>

technologies, either of which could materially harm our business. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and
other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially
according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for
novel product candidates, such as our eHSCs, can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied
pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Regulatory agencies administering existing or future regulations or legislation may not allow
production and marketing of products utilizing genome engineering technology in a timely manner or under technically or commercially
feasible conditions. In addition, regulatory action or private litigation could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our

in 2003, trials using early versions of murine gamma-retroviral vectors, which integrate with, and thereby alter, the host cell’s
DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including reported cases of leukemia. Adverse events in our clinical trials,
even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation,
unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements

a concern for gene therapy, and we cannot assure that it will not occur in any of our planned or future clinical trials. In addition,
there is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity
of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. If any such adverse events occur, commercialization
of our product candidates or further advancement of our clinical trials could be halted or delayed, which would have a negative impact

An RMAT is defined as cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination
products using any such therapies or products. Gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a durable modification
of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. The RMAT program is intended to facilitate efficient
development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease
or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for
such disease or condition. A biologics license application for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may
be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval. An RMAT may be eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition
and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment of the condition. An RMAT may
be eligible for accelerated approval through surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit
or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the
FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy
with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements
through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as
electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with

the Orphan Drug Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;1983, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat
a rare disease or condition. A similar regulatory scheme governs approval of orphan products by the EMA in the European Union. Generally,
if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which
it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or EMA from approving
another marketing application for the same product for the same therapeutic indication for that time period. The applicable period is
seven&nbsp;years in the United&nbsp;States and ten&nbsp;years in the European Union. The exclusivity period in the European Union can
be reduced to six&nbsp;years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, in particular if the product is sufficiently
profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.</span></p><div>

order for the FDA to grant orphan drug exclusivity to one of our products, the FDA must find that the product is indicated for the treatment
of a condition or disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United&nbsp;States. The FDA may
conclude that the condition or disease for which we may seek orphan drug exclusivity does not meet this standard. Even if we obtain orphan
drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products
can be approved for the same condition. In particular, the concept of what constitutes the “same drug” for purposes of orphan
drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies, and the FDA issued recent draft guidance suggesting that it would
not consider two genetic medicine products to be different drugs solely based on minor differences in the transgenes or vectors within
a given vector class. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product for the same
condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes
a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation
was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients
with the rare disease or condition.</span></p><div>

2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;2017 (the “FDARA”). FDARA, among other things, codified the
FDA’s pre-existing regulatory interpretation to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug
that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. Under
omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December&nbsp;27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies
to any drug and biologic that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017 but has not yet been approved or licensed
by the FDA.&nbsp;We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is
uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies,
our business could be adversely impacted.</span></p><div>

because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, our owned and licensed

prior art exists, it may be used to invalidate a patent, or may prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. For
example, such patent filings may be subject to a third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO, or to other patent offices around

we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these
agreements despite the existence of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures
is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of
the contractors, collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates
the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation. As a result, we could lose
our trade secrets. Enforcing a claim against a third party that illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation,
is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United&nbsp;States are sometimes less
willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects.</span></p><div>

administrative body in a foreign jurisdiction) objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend
significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws,
not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.&nbsp;Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining
a trademark registration may not provide an adequate defense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior
trademark. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability
to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement
claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks&nbsp;or

or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we
could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.</span></p><div>

An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties
or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive
products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.
Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable,
or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we
could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.</span></p><div>

if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only
monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in
connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure
during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares
of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue
such infringement claims, which typically last for&nbsp;years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims,
the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any
benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial

companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The
legal systems of some countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make
it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions
could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk
of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert
claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
commercially meaningful.</span></p><div>

countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses

In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party,
which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts
to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the
intellectual property that we develop or license, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations,

upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S.&nbsp;patents
may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug&nbsp;Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of&nbsp;1984,
referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent
term extension of up to five&nbsp;years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during
product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence
during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of
relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request.
Only one patent per approved product can be extended; the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond&nbsp;14&nbsp;years from
approval; and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If
we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can
enforce our patent rights for the applicable product candidate will be shortened, and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing
products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take
advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier
than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could

regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, and reimbursement for new medicines vary widely from country to country. In the
U.S., recently enacted legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and
cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a medicine before it can be marketed. In many
countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription
pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might
obtain marketing approval for a medicine in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial
launch of the medicine, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of
the medicine in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates,
even if any product candidates we may develop obtain marketing approval.</span></p><div>

ability to commercialize any medicines successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these medicines
and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations.
Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications
they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S.&nbsp;healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment.
Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for
particular medications. For example, in May&nbsp;2019, the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued
a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization for Medicare Party B drugs,
beginning January&nbsp;1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January&nbsp;1, 2019.</span></p><div>

and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control
drug costs. Individual states in the U.S.&nbsp;have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control

and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and
bulk purchasing.</span></p><div>

encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals
are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription
drug and other health care programs. Also, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined
discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be
available for any medicine that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact
the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is
available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing

does not imply that any medicine will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture,
sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new medicines, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and
may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the medicine and the clinical setting in which it is
used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost medicines and may be incorporated into existing payments for other
services. Net prices for medicines may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private
payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of medicines from countries where they may be sold at lower
prices than in the U.S.&nbsp;Any such reductions could negatively impact our net product sales, if any of our product candidates are

European Union has strict laws governing the provision of benefits or advantages to healthcare professionals in order to induce or encourage
the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products. Such laws and associated codes of
practice set out the rules and requirements that the provision of hospitality, sponsorship, gifts and promotional items must meet before
they can be accepted by healthcare professionals. The provision of benefits or advantages to healthcare professionals is also governed
by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.</span></p><div>

the United&nbsp;States, the federal government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the
passing of the ACA and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is
financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug
products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid
programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers
and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other aspects
of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related
costs, could also affect our business. There are, and may continue to be, judicial challenges, including review by the United&nbsp;States
Supreme Court. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts.

prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United&nbsp;States. To date, there
have been several recent U.S.&nbsp;congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among
other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce
the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. To those ends, President Trump
issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products. Certain of these orders are reflected in recently
promulgated regulations, including an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s most favored nation model, but such final
rule is currently subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction. It remains to be seen whether these orders and resulting regulations
will remain in force during the Biden Administration. Further, on September&nbsp;24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking
allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval.
Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result
in significant cost savings for consumers. The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved
drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).</span></p><div>

pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain
product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other
countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding
procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health
care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts
that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product

these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval

The U.K.&nbsp;Bribery Act prohibits inducements both to public officials and private individuals and organizations. Compliance with the
FCPA and the U.K.&nbsp;Bribery Act is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem.
In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated

regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer, and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly
evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has
established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer,
or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”) in May&nbsp;2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process
personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to
whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to
protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when
engaging third-party processors. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding
the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for
clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside
the European Union, including the United&nbsp;States, and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the
EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection,
such as the United&nbsp;States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used
personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or
20&nbsp;million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations
to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations
of the GDPR.&nbsp;In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting
the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.</span></p><div>

actions are either in place or under way in the United&nbsp;States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that are applicable
to our activities, and a wide range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy
and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General all are
aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and
federal levels. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;—&nbsp;which went into effect on January&nbsp;1, 2020 —&nbsp;is
creating similar risks and obligations as those created by the GDPR, though the California Consumer Privacy Act does exempt certain information
collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the Common Rule). In March&nbsp;2020,
the California State Attorney General proposed varying versions of companion draft regulations which are not yet finalized. Despite the
delay in adopting regulations, the California State Attorney General commenced enforcement actions against violators beginning July&nbsp;1,
2020. In addition, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was passed by California
voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that
are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). Further, a new
Virginia privacy law, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or VCDPA, was signed into law on March 2, 2021 and is also scheduled to
take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, will take effect on July 1, 2023. The VCDPA and CPA will impose
many similar obligations regarding the processing and storing of personal information as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the
CPRA. Many other states are considering similar legislation. A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal
level. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy
and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. There also is the threat of consumer class
actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws,
government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity,
which could harm our reputation and business.</span></p><div>

and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other disruptions. For example,
the loss of clinical trial data from future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly
increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. If we were to experience a significant cybersecurity breach of our information systems
or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation and potential notification of the breach to counter-parties and data
subjects could be material. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. If we do not allocate and effectively manage
the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology and cybersecurity infrastructure, we could suffer significant business
disruption, including transaction errors, supply chain or manufacturing interruptions, processing inefficiencies, data loss or the loss
of or damage to intellectual property or other proprietary information.</span></p><div>

widely reported, global credit and financial markets have experienced volatility and disruptions in the past several&nbsp;years and especially

in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There
can be no assurances that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur.
Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable
and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing
more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could
have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and share price and could require us to delay or abandon
clinical development plans.</span></p><div>

initiated class&nbsp;action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market
prices of these companies’ stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert

of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentration
of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging a potential acquirer from
making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change in control would benefit our other stockholders.
This significant concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive
disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.</p><div>

face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private
company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section&nbsp;404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented
by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&nbsp;of&nbsp;2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated
and to be promulgated thereunder, and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.
Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements
will require us to carry out activities we had not done previously. For example, we have adopted new charters for our board committees
and adopted some new disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred.
Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness
or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues,
and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of us. It may also be more expensive
to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to
attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other
obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal,
accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise
be used to expand our business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional
changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.</span></p><div>

accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the
requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have opted to take advantage
of the exemption for complying with new or revised accounting standards within the same time periods as private companies, which means
that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make
comparison of our consolidated financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging
growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences
in accounting standards used.</span></p><div>

(ii)&nbsp;any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers,
or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii)&nbsp;any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current

and (vi)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees governed by the internal
affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over
the indispensable parties named as defendants. These provisions would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created
by the Exchange&nbsp;Act. Furthermore, Section&nbsp;22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts
over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent
having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other
considerations, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United&nbsp;States of America shall
be exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of
action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions
are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum
provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions
of our Certificate of Incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,
and the provisions may not be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.</span></p><div>

exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes
with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. In addition, a stockholder that is
unable to bring a claim in the judicial forum of its choosing may be required to incur additional costs in the pursuit of actions that
are subject to these exclusive forum provisions, particularly if the stockholder does not reside in or near Delaware. Furthermore, the
enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation or bylaws has been challenged
in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a
court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in
an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which
could seriously harm our business.</span></p><div>

dedicated to enabling cures through hematopoietic stem cell therapy. We are focused on the development and commercialization of safer

product candidates designed to improve hematopoietic stem cell therapy. Our lead product candidate, JSP191, is in clinical development
as a novel conditioning antibody that clears hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow in patients prior to undergoing allogeneic stem
cell therapy or stem cell gene therapy. We are also developing engineered hematopoietic stem cells (“eHSC”) product candidates
reprogrammed using mRNA delivery and gene editing that have a competitive advantage over endogenous hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”)
because they permit higher levels of engraftment without the need for toxic conditioning of the patient and with potentially lower risk
of other serious complications seen with current stem cell transplants. We also plan to continue to expand our pipeline to include other
novel stem cell therapies based on immune modulation, graft engineering or cell and gene therapies. Our goal is to expand the use of
curative stem cell transplant and gene therapies for all patients, including children and the elderly.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Stem cell transplantation is among the most widely
practiced forms of cellular therapy and has the potential to cure a wide variety of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders and
autoimmune diseases. A stem cell transplant procedure involves three main steps: (i) stem cells from the patient’s or donor’s
bone marrow are collected; (ii) the patient’s bone marrow is cleared of any remaining stem cells in order to make space to receive
new transplanted stem cells, which is known as conditioning; and (iii) the new stem cells are transplanted into the patient via infusion
where they fasten to, or engraft in, the bone marrow and grow into the blood and immune cells that form the basis of reset and rebuilt
blood and immune systems. Transplants are either allogeneic or autologous, depending on the source of the new stem cells for the transplant.
In an allogeneic transplant, patients receive cells from a stem cell donor. In an autologous transplant, the patient’s own stem
cells are used. Autologous transplants also include stem cell gene therapies, where cells are collected from the patient, edited to either
enable a functioning gene or correct a defective gene, and then transplanted into the patient via infusion. Our programs span both allogeneic
and gene therapy-based autologous transplants, with initial sponsored programs in JSP191 based on an allogeneic approach.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Currently, patients must receive highly toxic
and potentially life-threatening conditioning agents to prepare their bone marrow for transplantation with either donor stem cells or
their own gene-edited stem cells. Younger, fitter patients capable of surviving these toxic side effects are typically given myeloablative,
or high-intensity, conditioning whereas older or less fit patients are typically given reduced intensity, but still toxic, conditioning
which leads to less effective transplants. These toxicities include a range of acute and chronic effects to the gastrointestinal tract,
kidneys, liver, lung, endocrine, and neurologic tissues. Depending upon the conditioning regimen, fitness of the patient, and compatibility
between the donor and recipient, the risk of transplant-related mortality ranges from 10% to more than 50% in older patients. Less toxic
ways to condition patients have been developed to enable transplant for older patients or those with major comorbidities, but these regimens
risk less potent disease elimination and higher rates of disease relapse. Even though stem cell therapy can be one of the most powerful
forms of disease cure, these limitations of non-targeted conditioning regimens have seen little innovation over the past decade.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our lead product candidate, JSP191, is a monoclonal antibody designed
to block a specific survival signal on stem cells and is in development as a highly targeted conditioning agent prior to stem cell therapy.
We are developing JSP191 for severe combined immunodeficiency (“SCID”) for which we are currently conducting an open label
Phase 1/2 clinical trial in two cohorts of SCID patients: patients with a history of a prior allogeneic transplant for SCID but with poor
graft outcomes and newly diagnosed SCID patients. The primary endpoint in Phase 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JSP191.
The two primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 2 are the proportion of subjects achieving adequate donor HSC engraftment and the proportion
of subjects achieving naïve T cell production greater than or equal to 85 cells/uL, a level expected to provide immune reconstitution,
during weeks 36 to 104 post-transplant. Based on preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we believe JSP191 has
demonstrated the ability as a single agent to enable engraftment of donor HSCs as determined by donor chimerism, or the percentage of
bone marrow cells in the patient that are of donor origin after transplant. Six out of the first nine non-IL2RG patients with prior allogeneic
transplant achieved donor engraftment, naïve donor T cell production and demonstrated clinical improvement. No JSP191 treatment-related
serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported to date and pharmacokinetics have been consistent with earlier studies
in healthy volunteers. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial by mid-2023.</p><div>

Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) or acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) that
were transplant eligible but still had trace evidence of leukemic cells that can remain in a patient after chemotherapy, or minimal residual
disease (“MRD”), as detected by cytogenetics, flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing. The primary endpoints are to
evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of JSP191. In the initial dose finding Phase 1a portion of this clinical
trial, 0.6 mg/kg JSP191-based conditioning was well tolerated in all six MDS/AML patients as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, it led
to successful engraftment as demonstrated by sustained blood neutrophil count of &gt;500 x 10^6 / L (Wolff 2002) in all six patients.
Additionally, five of the six patients demonstrated elimination of all diseased cells at day 90 (MRD) by multiple methods of detection,
a secondary endpoint of the clinical study. The next portion of the clinical trial, a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort has completed enrollment.
Initial results from the first seventeen patients show that 0.6 mg/kg JSP191-based conditioning was well tolerated with all seventeen
patients achieving successful engraftment. These initial results also show that twelve of fifteen Phase 1a and 1b patients with MRD at
screening achieved clearance of MRD. No JSP191 related serious adverse events have been reported. As of reporting of these initial results,
four patients have come off study, two due to relapse or disease progression, one due to late onset Grade 3 acute Graft vs Host Disease
(GvHD) and one due to secondary graft failure. We expect to present additional data from this study in the first half of 2022.&nbsp;</p><div>

with Stanford University to study JSP191-based conditioning in patients with Fanconi anemia. This study is currently open for patient
recruitment. We are also collaborating with the National Institutes of Health to conduct clinical trials of JSP191-based conditioning
in patients with sickle cell disease (“SCD”), with chronic granulomatous disease and with GATA-2 mutated MDS. We believe
that JSP191 may also be useful for conditioning in allogenic transplant for other diseases beyond which we are currently studying, including
autoimmune diseases. We also believe that targeted JSP191-based conditioning may improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapies. We
are working with Graphite Bio, Inc. (“Graphite Bio”) for gene therapy in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency
(“X-SCID”) first as a non-clinical collaboration with an option to expand to clinical trials,as well as with Aruvant Sciences

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We plan to evaluate JSP191 as a therapeutic for
certain patients with proliferative disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder of the bone marrow which
typically occurs in an older population and can progress to AML. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (“IPSS-R”)
is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate risk and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients. Patients with IPSS-R scores of low or
very low are not typically referred to stem cell transplant due to the risk of transplant-related toxicities from current conditioning
regiments, infection and GvHD outweighing the patient’s expected survival with drug therapies. These patients typically suffer
from anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and are given drug therapies such as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (“ESA”)
to stimulate production of new cells to correct their blood deficiency. However, these agents do not target the diseased hematopoietic
stem cell and patients who become refractory to ESA are dependent on routine blood transfusions, which is associated with poor survival.
ESA-refractory low-risk MDS patients have few treatment options and are a clinical unmet need.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">JSP191 and other anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies
have been shown to deplete normal and diseased MDS human hematopoietic stem cells in clinical and pre-clinical studies. In studies of
non-human primates and healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of JSP191 resulted in depletion of healthy hematopoietic stem
cells followed by recovery in approximately six weeks. Additional recent clinical data in MDS patients undergoing stem cell transplant
showed depletion of hematopoietic stem cells after administration of JSP191 alone. By depleting diseased and healthy hematopoietic stem
cells, we believe that JSP191 may allow for preferential recovery of healthy hematopoietic stem cells and restoration of normal hematopoiesis.
We intend to study JSP191 monotherapy in low-risk MDS patients with documented cytopenia who are refractory to ESA therapy.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our eHSC platform is designed to overcome key
limitations of stem cell transplant and stem cell gene therapy. By using mRNA delivery and/or gene editing, we believe we can reprogram
donor or gene corrected stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage over the patient’s existing cells.
We believe initial preclinical experiments by Jasper demonstrate multiple different mRNAs can be used to improve engraftment of modified
stem cells. One example are eHSCs that express certain variants of CXCR4 that may lead to improved stem cell homing and engraftment in
the bone marrow. Another example includes expression of a modified stem cell factor receptor that can lead to cell line proliferation
independent of stem cell factor (“SCF”) concentration, enabling our eHSCs to outcompete unmodified HSCs through better survival
and engraftment. Also, since JSP191 only blocks signaling through the stem cell factor receptor, these eHSCs are not affected by JSP191
when used in combination. Other initial experiments have shown that mRNA can be used to express these receptor variants on the cell surface.
We have also identified other potential receptor modifications that prevent the binding of JSP191 but retain the ability to bind SCF,
therefore allowing the eHSCs to proliferate normally even in the presence of JSP191.</p><div>

March&nbsp;2020, the World Health Organization declared the global COVID-19&nbsp;outbreak a pandemic. The global COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic
continues to evolve rapidly, including with respect to the spread of variants, and we will continue to monitor it closely. While our
operations to date have not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, we cannot at this time predict the specific extent,
duration, or full impact that the continuing COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic will have on our business, financial condition and operations, including
ongoing and planned clinical trials and clinical development timelines, particularly as we advance our product candidates to clinical
development, the continued spread of COVID-19&nbsp;and its variants, including Omicron, and the measures taken by the governmental authorities
could disrupt the supply chain and the manufacture or shipment of drug substances and finished drug products for our product candidates
for use in our clinical trials, impede our clinical trial initiation and recruitment and the ability of patients to continue in clinical
trials, impede testing, monitoring, data collection and analysis and other related activities. The COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic could also
potentially affect the business of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in delays in meetings related to our ongoing
and planned clinical trials. We experienced slower than anticipated patient enrollment in our SCID clinical trial in 2020 due to reluctance
of these immunocompromised patients to travel and undergo hospitalization during the pandemic. We may continue to experience interruptions
to our clinical trials due to the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic on our financial performance will
depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on our clinical trial enrollment, trial
sites, contract research organizations (“CROs”), CMOs, and other third parties with whom we do business, its impact on regulatory
authorities and our key scientific and management personnel, progress of vaccination and related governmental advisories and restrictions.
These developments and the impact of the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain
and cannot be predicted. If the financial markets or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period, our business may be materially
adversely affected.</span></p><div>

Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, on the Closing Date, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into Old Jasper (the “Merger”), with
Old Jasper as the surviving company in the Merger, and, after giving effect to the Merger, Old Jasper became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AMHC and changed its name to “Jasper Tx Corp.”, and (ii) AMHC changed its name to “Jasper Therapeutics, Inc.”.</span></p><div>

November&nbsp;21, 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen (the “Amgen License Agreement”) pursuant to which
we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license for certain patents, data, and non-data&nbsp;know-how&nbsp;related to Amgen’s proprietary
monoclonal antibody known as AMG191, as renamed to JSP191. Concurrently with the execution of the license agreement, Amgen assigned to
us its rights and obligations under the Investigator Sponsored Research Agreement (“ISRA”) previously entered into in June&nbsp;2013
between Amgen and The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”) related to the clinical study
of JSP191.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Under the ISRA, we received an option to negotiate a definitive license
with Stanford for rights to certain Stanford intellectual property related to the study of JSP191 in exchange for an option exercise fee
of $1.0 million, payable over a two-year period (the “Option”). There are no other fees due under the ISRA. We exercised the
Option in June 2020, and the definitive license with Stanford was executed in March 2021. Upon exercise of the Option, the $1.0 million
option exercise fee was recognized as a research and development cost. In June 2020, we and Stanford agreed that the Investigational New
Drug Application (“IND”) and control of the study related to this ISRA would be transferred to us. We paid $0.4 million related
to the option exercise fee during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unpaid option fees liability of $0.2 million is
included in current liabilities as of December 31, 2021.</p><div>

the Amgen License Agreement, we issued Amgen 100 shares of Old Jasper’s Series A-2 redeemable convertible preferred stock in November
2019, the fair value of which was estimated at $0.9 million, which was recognized as a research and development expense in the same period.
These shares were converted into 2,200,000 shares of voting common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination.</p><div>

We recognized $9.3 million of other income related to the decrease in the fair value of the earnout liability for the year ended December

our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows, and based on our current operating plan, we have concluded that there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these consolidated financial
statements. We expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborations or a combination
of these approaches. The sale of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and, in the case of
preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those
of our common stock. Debt financings may subject us to covenant limitations or restrictions on our ability to take specific actions, such
as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by negative
global economic conditions and any disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United&nbsp;States and worldwide
that may result from the ongoing COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic or other factors. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring
additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate
financing when needed or on terms favorable or acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more

additional five years to August 2031. In addition to base rent, we pay our share of operating expenses and taxes. As of December 31, 2021,
our rent commitments under the original lease agreement are $0.7 million within the next 12 months from December 31, 2021, and $2.7 million

allogeneic transplant with non-sibling donors at Stanford Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (the “Research Project”)
using JSP191. As consideration for the services performed by Stanford under this sponsored research agreement, we will pay Stanford a
total of $0.9 million over approximately 3 years upon the achievement of development and clinical milestones, including FDA filings and
patients’ enrollment. In February 2021, we paid $0.3 million related to the achievement of the first milestone under this agreement.
In February 2022, the second milestone was achieved, and at that point we accrued an additional $0.3 million. The third milestone is based
on the progress of the clinical trials and will be recognized when achieved.</p><div>

have entered into various agreements with outsourced vendors, including CROs and CMOs. Research and development expenses are recognized
as services are performed and as costs occur. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each
reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different
than the actual amounts incurred, such estimates for the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing
of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any one period. Our accrual is
dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs, CMOs, and other third-party vendors. Variations in the
assumptions used to estimate accruals including, but not limited to, the number of patients enrolled, the rate of patient enrollment
and the actual services performed, may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expenses in future periods.
Payments made under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses and other
current assets until the services are rendered. To date, there have been no material differences between estimates of such expenses and
the amounts actually incurred.</span></p><div>

of the prices of shares of common stock of publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the risk-free interest rate by reference to the
U.S.&nbsp;Treasury yield curve over the expected term. The expected term equals the remaining contractual term of the escrow, which ends
on September 24, 2024. Common stock fair value equals the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the valuation
date. An increase or decrease in the common stock fair value and volatility assumptions will significantly increase or decrease the recorded

of research and development efforts and the material risks relating to the business and industry; our results of operations and financial

our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for

to the provision of income taxes in the period when such determination is made. As of December&nbsp;31, 2021, we&nbsp;recorded a full

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply
with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a U.S. Securities Act of
1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards.
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply
to non-emerging&nbsp;growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have opted to take advantage of the exemption
for complying with new or revised accounting standards within the same time periods as private companies, which means that when a standard
is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt
the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our consolidated
financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted
out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</span></p><div>

misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</span></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</span></p><div>

Therapeutics, Inc. (“Jasper” or the “Company”), formerly known as Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation
(“AMHC”), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to enabling cures through hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of safer, more effective conditioning agents and stem cell grafts to
allow for expanded use of curative therapy with stem cell transplantation and gene therapies. Its drug development pipeline includes
multiple product candidates designed to improve stem cell transplants. The lead compound, JSP191, is in clinical development as a conditioning
antibody that clears hematopoietic (blood and bone marrow) stem cells from bone marrow in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.
The Company is also developing engineered hematopoietic stem cell products. The Company is headquartered in Redwood City, California.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</span></p></ix:continuation></span><div>

and raise additional capital through a combination of public and private equity, debt financings, strategic alliances, and licensing
arrangements. The Company’s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to the Company

preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions
and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant
estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to the valuation of
common and redeemable convertible preferred stock before the Reverse Recapitalization, the determination of the incremental borrowing
rate used for operating lease liabilities, valuation of derivative liability, valuation of earnout liability and the measurement of stock-based&nbsp;compensation
expense. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts
those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></span></p></ix:continuation></span></ix:continuation></span><div>

an asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset

may not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
the fair value of the assets. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, principally discounted cash flow models,
to assess the fair values of long-lived assets. The Company did not record any impairment of long-lived assets during the years ended

Company has entered into various agreements with outsourced vendors, CMOs and CROs. The Company makes estimates of accrued research and
development expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. The Company periodically confirms
the accuracy of its estimates with the service providers and makes adjustments, if necessary. Research and development accruals are estimated
based on the level of services performed, progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, and contracted costs.
The estimated costs of research and development services provided, but not yet invoiced, are included in accrued expenses on the balance
sheets. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the original estimates, the Company will
adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded
as prepaid expenses and other current assets until the services are rendered. To date, there have been no material differences between
estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></span></p></ix:continuation></span></ix:continuation></span><div>

Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under U.S. GAAP. This determination is primarily based on Old Jasper’s
stockholders comprising a relative majority of the voting power of the Company and having the ability to nominate the members of the
Board, Old Jasper’s operations prior to the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Company, and Old Jasper’s
senior management comprising a majority of the senior management of the Company. Under this method of accounting, AMHC is treated as
the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Old Jasper with the Business Combination being treated
as the equivalent of the Company issuing stock for the net assets of AMHC, accompanied by a reverse recapitalization. The net assets
of AMHC are stated at historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination
are presented as those of Old Jasper.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</span></p></ix:continuation></span><div>

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for

the triggering events described above are achieved during the Earnout Period. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, the contingent
obligation to release the Earnout Shares was accounted for as a liability classified financial instrument upon their initial recognition
because the triggering events that determine the number of shares required to be released from escrow include events that were not solely
indexed to the common stock of the Company. The earnout liability is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized
in earnings.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</span></p></ix:continuation></span><div>

to the Business Combination, the grant date fair value of Old Jasper’s common stock was determined by its board of directors with
the assistance of management and an independent third-party valuation specialist. The grant date fair value of Old Jasper’s common
stock was determined using valuation methodologies that utilize certain assumptions including probability weighting of events, volatility,
time to liquidation, a risk-free interest rate and an assumption for a discount for lack of marketability (Level 3 inputs). In determining
the fair value of Old Jasper’s common stock, the methodologies used to estimate the enterprise value of Old Jasper were performed
using methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and
Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.</span></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</span></p></ix:continuation></span><div>

maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that

including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required

of achieving the desired control objectives. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange
Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
